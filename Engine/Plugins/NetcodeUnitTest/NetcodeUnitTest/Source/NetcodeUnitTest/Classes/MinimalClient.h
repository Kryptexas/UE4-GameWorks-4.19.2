/**
 * Refactoring Plan
 *
 * There are still more steps that need to be done, for refactoring the rest of the minimal client features over from ClientUnitTest,
 * and then expanding ClientUnitTest to work with multiple minimal clients - many steps would be useful for the Fortnite MCP support.
 *
 * The plan is to, eventually, completely eliminate nearly all of the MinimalClient delegates that tie back to ClientUnitTest,
 * and to have minimal client functionality implemented through virtual functions in MinimalClient subclasses instead,
 * and then to expand ClientUnitTest to support multiple/unlimited MinimalClient's, with two default beacon/game minimal clients.
 *
 * This will require changing all unit tests (notably, having a new MinimalClient subclass for every unit test, implementing the test),
 * and has a lot of stages that still need doing/planning; it is taking up too much time though,
 * so you will have to implement it piecemeal, and will have to make-do with an imperfect implementation of the Fortnite MCP support,
 * through a UnitTask - implementing that with the final refactored system, later.
 *
 *
 * Required steps:
 *		- Step 0: Not directly related - but implement Fortnite MCP support before any of the below.
 *
 *		- Step 1: Move last of EUnitTestFlags, into MinimalClient
 *			- Possibly, you may end up doing this in a MinimalClient subclass, or moving existing class down to MinimalClientBase,
 *				but this complicates the delegate parameters (which will be removed later anyway, so maybe not problem...),
 *				and EMinClientFlags (flags would define functionality across both base and superclass)
 *
 *			- Specifically, the requirements flags and advanced implementation of notifications, may be more suitable for a subclass,
 *				as it would be nice to keep the barebones connection code within the base class
 *
 *			- For unit-test specific events that are tied up in the middle of the moved code
 *				(like firing off the unit test after conditions are correctly set), you'll have to add new delegates
 *
 *
 *		- Step 2: Implement a virtual function interface in MinimalClient, matching that in ClientUnitTest 
 *			- Keep the delegates around for the moment, just tie them into the virtual interface for now
 *
 *			- All new unit tests should use this interface, instead of the old ClientUnitTest interface
 *
 *
 *		- Step 3: Convert all unit tests to the new interface, and remove the delegate interface when done
 *			- Do this piecemeal, as it is a big job, touching all unit tests
 *
 *
 *		- Step 4: Implement support for multiple/unlimited minimal clients, in ClientUnitTest,
 *			and support for the two default beacon/game minimal clients
 *
 *
 *		- Step 5: Refactor the Fortnite MCP support, into a MinimalClient subclass (for the beacon connection),
 *			perhaps keeping the MCP side within the UnitTask
