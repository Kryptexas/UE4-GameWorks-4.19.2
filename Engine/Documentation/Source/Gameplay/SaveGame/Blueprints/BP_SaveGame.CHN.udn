Description:How to save and load your game using Blueprints


### Create a SaveGame Object

To create a new SaveGame object, [create a new Blueprint Class](Engine\Blueprints\UserGuide\Types\ClassBlueprint\Creation). When the Pick Parent Class dialog pops up, expand the **Custom Classes** 
dropdown, then select **SaveGame**. You can use the search box to jump directly to SaveGame.

In your new SaveGame object Blueprint, create variables for any information you would like to save.  

[REGION:note]
In this example, there are also variables declared that will be used to store default values for the SaveSlotName and the UserIndex, so that each class that saves to this
SaveGame object will not have to independently set those variables. This step is optional, and will cause there to be one save slot that gets overwritten if the default values are not changed.

You can set default values for the variables after the Blueprint is compiled. 


### Saving a Variable

First, create an instance, or copy, of your SaveGame object, using the **Create Save Game Object** node. Make sure you set the Save Game Class dropdown to the name of your new SaveGame object Blueprint, 
in this case, **MySaveGame**. Because the Create Save Game Object node creates a generic SaveGame object copy, you have to drag off of the **Return Value** pin and **Cast to MySaveGame**. Save
the result of the casting to a variable so that you can reuse the SaveGame object easily later on.

Now that you have a copy of your custom SaveGame object, MySaveGame, saved to the **Save Game Instance** variable, you can send information to it. Here, the **Player Name** is being set to 
"Player One". You would repeat this step for any other variables you wanted to store information in.

Now, you can use the **Save Game To Slot** node to save the SaveGame object's information to the hard drive. The **Save Game To Slot** node takes in a file name and a user ID, which in this case, are the 
default values created earlier.

### Loading a Variable

This first step is optional, and is based on saving a default save slot and user ID within the SaveGame object. Here, an empty SaveGame object is first created, so the default SaveSlotName and UserIndex 
can be read from it. Again, this may not apply in all game implementations.

You can use the **Load Game From Slot** node to create an instance of your SaveGame object Blueprint. Just like when you created a SaveGame object for saving information, you need to cast to your specific 
SaveGame object Blueprint so that you can save the result to a variable for easy access later.

Once the new SaveGame object has been loaded from the hard drive, the variable values can be read from it and assigned to the necessary Actors or classes, or used directly as shown here.
