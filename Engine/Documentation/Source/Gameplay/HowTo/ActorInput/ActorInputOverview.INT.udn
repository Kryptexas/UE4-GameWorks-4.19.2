Crumbs: %ROOT%, Gameplay
Description:A How To Guide to Setting up Input for an Actor in Unreal Engine 4. 

When developing your game, there may be instances when you want to allow the player to perform some form of **Input** on an Actor in your level. For example, perhaps you have a treasure chest that you want the player to be able to open when they approach it, or a light you want them to be able to turn on/off, or some other form of interactable object you want to affect in some way when the player presses a button. 

Setting up Input for an Actor gives you a level of control over how and when the Actor responds to player input. For more information, see the link provided in the **Setup** section below.
