Description:A How To Guide for Spawning/Destroying Actors through Blueprints in Unreal Engine 4. 

[TOC (start:2)]

 Here you will learn how to spawn an Actor in Blueprints and define its spawn location. You will also learn how to destroy spawned Actors. 

## Spawning an Actor

Below you will find steps to spawn an Actor in the level by pressing a key. 

1.  Open up any project, once inside the editor, click the **Blueprints** button and **Open Level Blueprint**.

	[/REGION]

1.  This will open the **Blueprint Editor** window (shown below).

	In order to spawn an Actor, we will need to use the Spawn Actor from Class node. In this example, we are using the Level Blueprint, however you can use the Spawn Actor from Class node in most Blueprints where it can be found in the Palette window as shown below.

1.  **Right-click** anywhere in the graph and in the context menu, search for and add the **Spawn Actor from Class** node. 

	![](GHT1_5.png)

1.  The **Spawn Actor from Class** node will be added to the graph (**SpawnActor** for short). 

	![](GHT1_4.png)

	The Spawn Actor from Class node takes an Actor Class (specified via the Class input) and attempts to spawn an instance of that class in the world. The Spawn Transform input is used to define the Actor's spawn location in the world (and its initial orientation). If that location is blocked by a collider, then the Actor will fail to spawn unless the Spawn Even if Colliding input is set to True. 

	Each of the pins on the Spawn Actor node are outlined below.

	![](GHT1_6.png)

	| Number | Description |
	| ------- | ------------ |
	| **Execution Input (1)** | This is an execution input and is what triggers the node to spawn an Actor. |
	| **Class (2)** | This is the Actor Class you want to spawn an instance of in the world (this is required). |
	| **Spawn Transform (3)** | This takes in a Transform used to position and orientate the Actor in the world. |
	| **Spawn Even If Colliding (4)** | Determines if the Actor should be spawned when something is blocking the spawn location. |
	| **Execution Output (5)** | This is an execution output and leads to script that should occur following the Spawn Actor. |
	| **Return Value (6)** | This outputs the new Actor instance that is spawned in the world. |

1.  Click the **Class** drop-down menu and then select an Actor from the list of Actors you want to spawn. 

	![](GHT1_7.png)

1.  After selecting the Actor you want to spawn, the node will update and a new pin will be added. 

	![](GHT1_8.png)

	The Instigator is optional and is the Pawn responsible for damage done by the spawned Actor.

1.  **Left-click** and drag off the **Spawn Transform** pin to the left, then in the context menu search for and add **Get Actor Transform**. 

	![](GHT1_9.png)

	The **Get Actor Transform** node is telling the **Spawn Actor** where to spawn the new Actor we want to spawn.

1.  **Left-click** and drag off the **Get Actor Transform** pin, then in the context menu search for and add **Get Player Character**. 

	![](GHT1_10.png)

	This is now saying, Get the Player Character then Get their Transform and assign that to the **Spawn Transform**. 

1.  **Right-click** anywhere in the graph, and in the context menu, search for and add the **F** Key Event. 

	![](GHT1_11.png)	

1.  Connect the **Pressed** pin to the **Execute Input** pin of the **SpawnActor** node. 

	![](GHT1_12.png)

	This now says, execute the **SpawnActor** when **F** is pressed and spawn the Actor at the Player Character's Transform. 

1.  Click the **Compile** button then close the **Blueprint**. 

	Before Compile:

	After Successful Compile: 

	![](GHT1_14.png)

	If you do not see the green check mark, verify that all your nodes are connected and an **Actor Class** is specified on the **SpawnActor** node.

1.  From the main window, click the **Play** Button to play in the editor. 

	[REGION:raw]
	![](GHT1_15.png)
	[/REGION]

	Whenever you press **F**, the Actor you selected should spawn where the player character is in the world.

This example illustrates spawning an Actor through a key press, however you could use any number of Events to execute the SpawnActor node. 

Refer to the [](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide) for more on working with **Blueprints**. 

## Setting a Spawn Point

If you want to spawn an Actor at a specified location, you can do this by setting the Transform manually or by referencing another Actor's Transform.

The examples below will show you how to manually set a Transform as well as reference an Actor's Transform to use as a spawn location.

1.  Open up any project, once inside the editor, click the **Blueprints** button and **Open Level Blueprint**.  

	[REGION:raw]
	![](GHT1_1.png)
	[/REGION]

1.	In the graph window, **Right-click** and search for then add the **Spawn Actor from Class** node. 

	![](GHT1_5.png)

1.	On the **SpawnActor** node, click the **Class** drop-down menu and select an Actor to spawn. 

	![](GHT1_7.png)

1.	Minimize the **Level Blueprint** window. 

1.  From the Main Editor window, under **Modes**, search for **Target** and drag a **Target Point** into your level. 

	[REGION:raw]
	![](GHT1_16.png)
	[/REGION]

1.  Return to the **Level Blueprint** window, then **Right-click** in the graph and choose **Add Reference to TargetPoint**.

	![](GHT1_17.png)

1.  **Left-click** drag off the out pin of the newly added node and search for and add **Get Actor Transform**. 

	![](GHT1_18.png)

1.  Connect the **Return Value** of the **Get Actor Transform** node to the **Spawn Transform** in pin. 

1.	**Right-click** in the graph and search for and add the **F** Key Event, then off **Pressed** connect it to the **SpawnActor**. 

	![](GHT1_19.png)

	We used a Key Press Event to execute the **SpawnActor** node, however you can use any method you wish.

1.	**Compile** then close the **Blueprint** and play in the editor, you should see your Actor spawn at the Target Point. 

In addition to specifying a spawn point by referencing an Actor, you can manually enter the Spawn Transform for the SpawnActor as well, to do this: 

1.	Drag off the **Spawn Transform** pin of a **SpawnActor** node, then select **Make Transform**. 

	![](GHT1_21.png)

1.	This will create a **Make Transform** node where you can enter the **Location**, **Rotation**, and **Scale** manually. 

	![](GHT1_22.png)

## Destroying a Spawned Actor

Once you have spawned an Actor, suppose you wanted to destroy it (for example, maybe the player killed the Actor or picked the Actor up as a pick-up, etc.). 

Below are the steps you can take to destroy a Spawned Actor in the Level Blueprint. 

1.  Open up any project, once inside the editor, click the **Blueprints** button and **Open Level Blueprint**.  

	[REGION:raw]
	![](GHT1_1.png)
	[/REGION]

1.	In the graph window, **Right-click** and search for then add the **Spawn Actor from Class** node. 

	![](GHT1_5.png)

1.	On the **SpawnActor** node, click the **Class** drop-down menu and select an Actor to spawn. 

	![](GHT1_7.png)

1.	**Left-click** and drag off the **Spawn Transform** pin and add a **Get Actor Transform** node. 

1.	**Left-click** and drag off the **Get Actor Transform** node and add a **Get Player Character** node. 

1.	**Right-click** in an empty space in the graph, then search for the **F** Key Event node and connect it to the **SpawnActor** node. 

	![](GHT1_12.png)

1.	**Left-click** and drag off the **Execute Out** pin of the **SpawnActor** and add a **Delay** node. 

1. On the **Delay** node, set the duration to **3** (this is the amount of seconds to wait before we destroy the Actor). 

1. **Left-click** and drag off the **Return Value** of the **SpawnActor** and add a **Destroy Actor** node, then connect as shown below.

	[/REGION]

	_Click image for full view._

1.	**Compile** then close the **Blueprint** and play in the editor, you should see the Actor spawn at the player location then despawn after 3 seconds. 

As with executing the SpawnActor node to spawn an Actor, destroying the Actor can be triggered by several different types of Events based on your needs. 

Refer to the [](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide) for more on working with Blueprints.
