[TOC (start:2 end:3)]

## Overview

The Unreal Build System makes use of **Target** files for each application UnrealBuildTool builds that get compiled into the dynamic Rules module. These files replace the old `UEBuild*.cs` files that were originally compiled directly into UnrealBuildTool. Each target file defines a class used by UnrealBuildtool to determine how a game or program is built.

UnrealBuildTool now retrieves the proper target for the project being built from the RulesModule.dll.

There are 2 types of target:

* **Game** - This is a target that utilizes the 'shared' UE4 executable.
* **Program** - This is a target that is a stand-alone executable. ShaderCompileWorker, SlateViewer, and UnrealHeaderTool are this type of target.


## Target File Naming and Location

The Target file must be located in the root directory of a program or `Source` directory of a game and be named using the convention: `[APPNAME].Target.cs`

As an example, the ShaderCompileWorker program directory at `\UE4\Engine\Source\Programs\ShaderCompileWorker` contains the `ShaderCompileWorker.Target.cs` file.

Similarly, the ExampleGame `Source` directory located at `UE4\ExampleGame|Source` contains the `ExampleGame.Target.cs` file.

## Target File Contents

The class defined in the Target file for each game or program is derived from `TargetRules` (found in `RulesCompiler.cs`). 

The name of the class is constructed by adding the name of the tool or game followed by `target`. For instance, the class defined in the target file for the ShaderCompileWorker tool would be `ShaderCompileWorkerTarget`. The `Target` at the end is **REQUIRED**. It was added to avoid name collisions with the existing `*.Build.cs` module rules classes, since they all get compiled into the same DLL.

UnrealBuildTool takes `[APPNAME]` and appends `Target` when requesting the build target from the Rules DLL. So, using the same example as above, when UnrealBuildTool is passed `ShaderCompileWorker Win64 Development` it will request `ShaderCompileWorkerTarget` as the `TargetRules` class name of interest.

### Constructor

The constructor sets the name of the application and the type of target to generate. Here is the constructor for ExampleGameTarget for comparison:
	
	public ExampleGameTarget(TargetInfo Target)
	{
		Type = TargetType.Game;
		Name = "ExampleGame";
	}

### Setup Binaries

`TargetRules::SetupBinaries()` is used to generate a list of `UEBuildBinaryConfiguration` instances which UnrealBuildTool will use to fill in the AppBinaries array (these are what it will generate).

### Setup Global Environment

`TargetRules::SetupGlobalEnvironment()` is used to set various build configuration settings for UnrealBuildTool for the target as well as setup the global Compile and Link environments.

[REGION:note]
**Note:** The current games do not contain this function, as the UEBuildGame class takes care of their needs by default. However, if a game needed to override these settings, it certainly can do so.

## Example Target File

Here is the ShaderCompileWorker.Target.cs file as a complete example:

	// Copyright 1998-2015 Epic Games, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

	using UnrealBuildTool;
	using System.Collections.Generic;

	public class ShaderCompileWorkerTarget : TargetRules
	{
		public ShaderCompileWorkerTarget(TargetInfo Target)
		{
			Type = TargetType.Program;
			Name = "ShaderCompileWorker";
		}

		//
		// TargetRules interface.
		//

		public override void SetupBinaries(
			TargetInfo Target,
			ref List<UEBuildBinaryConfiguration> OutBuildBinaryConfigurations,
			ref List<string> OutExtraModuleNames
			)
		{
			List<string> LinkModules = new List<string>() { "Core", "ShaderCore", "RenderCore", "RHI", "WindowsTools", "ShaderCompileWorker" };
			OutBuildBinaryConfigurations.Add(
				new UEBuildBinaryConfiguration(	InType: UEBuildBinaryType.Executable,
												InModuleNames: LinkModules )
				);
		}

		public override void SetupGlobalEnvironment(
			TargetInfo Target,
			ref LinkEnvironmentConfiguration OutLinkEnvironmentConfiguration,
			ref CPPEnvironmentConfiguration OutCPPEnvironmentConfiguration
			)
		{
			// Turn off various third party features we don't need
			UEBuildConfiguration.bAllowSteamworks = false;
			UEBuildConfiguration.bAllowLive = false;
			UEBuildConfiguration.bCompilePerforce = false;

			// Currently we force Lean and Mean mode
			UEBuildConfiguration.bCompileLeanAndMeanUE = true;

			// Currently this app is not linking against the engine, so we'll compile out references from Core to the rest of the engine
			UEBuildConfiguration.bCompileAgainstEngine = false;

			// ShaderCompileWorker is a console application, not a Windows app (sets entry point to main(), instead of WinMain())
			OutLinkEnvironmentConfiguration.bIsBuildingConsoleApplication = true;

			// Disable logging, as the workers are spawned often and logging will just slow them down
			OutCPPEnvironmentConfiguration.Definitions.Add("ALLOW_LOG_FILE=0");
			OutCPPEnvironmentConfiguration.Definitions.Add("HACK_HEADER_GENERATOR=1");
			OutCPPEnvironmentConfiguration.Definitions.Add("HACK_SHADER_COMPILER_WORKER=1");
		}
