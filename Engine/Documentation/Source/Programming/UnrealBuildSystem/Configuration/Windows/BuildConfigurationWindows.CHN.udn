Title:Configuring Unreal Build System for Windows
Crumbs: %ROOT%, Programming, Programming/UnrealBuildSystem/Configuration
Description:Configuring Unreal Build System to control how the engine is built for Windows.
Version: 4.5

The Unreal Build System can be configured through the `BuildConfiguration.cs` to modify the build process to suit a variety of needs.
For Windows specific options, you can alter the `UEBuildWindows.cs` configuration

## Adding Windows XP Support

### Minimum Spec

**Only Windows XP with Service Pack 3 is supported**.

**You also must have a Video Card which supports OpenGL 3.2**.

### Building with Windows XP support
$ WindowsPlatform::SupportWindowsXP : If _true_, a build of UE4 which is compatible with Windows XP will be created.


To enable XP support, find where it is forced off in the `SetupEnvironment` and update this, with:
	public override void SetUpEnvironment(UEBuildTarget InBuildTarget)
	{
		...

		// Win32 XP is only supported at this time.
		SupportWindowsXP = InBuildTarget.Platform == UnrealTargetPlatform.Win32;

Enabling a Windows XP compatible build forces the compiler to use `Windows SDK 7.1`. This will mean that any functionality which has been provided by the `Windows SDK 8.0` will not compile. You can wrap sdk specific code in a WINVER check:
	#if WINVER == 0x0502
		// Windows SDK 7.1 code should live inside this block
	#else
		// Windows SDK 8.0 code should live inside this block
	#endif
	
### Getting the game running on Windows XP

As Windows XP does not support DirectX 10 or DirectX 11, OpenGL must be included as a target RHI for your game.

You can find the option to include this in the Editor:
_Edit->Project Settings->Platform->Windows_
[![](EnableOpenGLForWindows.png)](Programming/UnrealBuildSystem/Configuration/Windows)

Once you have packaged your game, you should then be able to run the game executable from the binaries directory on a Windows XP machine.
