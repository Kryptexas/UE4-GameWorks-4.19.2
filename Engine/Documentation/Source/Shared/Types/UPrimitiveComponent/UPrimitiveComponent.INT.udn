[COMMENT:none]
 
 Indicates if we'd like to create physics state all the time (for collision and simulation). 
 If you set this to false, it still will create physics state if collision or simulation activated. 
 This can help performance if you'd like to avoid overhead of creating physics state when triggers 

[/COMMENT]
[EXCERPT:bAlwaysCreatePhysicsState]

If disabled, there will be a run time processing overhead for creating the Physics State for this component if it is collided with or starts simulating.

[COMMENT:none]
 If true, this component will generate overlap events when it is overlapping other components (e.g. ReceiveBeginOverlap, NotifyEncroachedBy) 
[/COMMENT]
[EXCERPT:bGenerateOverlapEvents]

An overlap between two objects will register if both objects set this flag to true. This way an object can opt out of all overlap events by turning its own flag off.
Once an overlap event occurs, it will generate an Event for Blueprints or Code to use to define behavior. With Multi Body Overlap disabled, only a single overlap event will be generated when any number of Physics Bodies are overlapping it.
The collision profiles of the overlapping objects determine if an overlap will generate a Hit Event or an Overlap Event.

[/EXCERPT:bGenerateOverlapEvents]


[COMMENT:none]
 If true, this component will generate individual overlaps for each overlapping physics body if it is a multi-body component. When false, this component will
generate only one overlap, regardless of how many physics bodies it has and how many of them are overlapping another component/body. This flag has no
influence on single body components. 
[/COMMENT]
[EXCERPT:bMultiBodyOverlap]

If set to True, this will allow this Component to generate overlap events for every Physics Body it contains.

If disabled, only one overlap event will be generated for all the physics bodies this Component contains.

[COMMENT:none]
 If true, this component will look for collisions on both physic scenes during movement 
[/COMMENT]
[EXCERPT:bCheckAsyncSceneOnMove]

This flag, though appearing everywhere, only works on the capsule associated with a movement component, such as the one that comes with creating a Character Blueprint.

Outside of this one case, Physics Bodies can only exist and interact in one of the two scenes.

[COMMENT:none]
 If true, component sweeps with this component should trace against complex collision during movement. 
[/COMMENT]
[EXCERPT:bTraceComplexOnMove]

This flag, though appearing everywhere, only works on the capsule associated with a movement component, such as the one that comes with creating a Character Blueprint.

Complex Collision is per-face collision, allowing a character to collide and interact with concave shapes or more complicated Actors. However, it is more costly to compute and should only be used if necessary.

[COMMENT:none]
 If true, component sweeps will return the material in their hit-info. 
[/COMMENT]
[EXCERPT:bReturnMaterialOnMove]

Only useful when used on the collision object for a Movement Component, such as the one that comes with a Character or Pawn.

When enabled, this will return the Phys Material in the hit result.

[COMMENT:none]
 
 Whether to render the primitive in the depth only pass.  
 Setting this to false will cause artifacts with dominant light shadows and potentially large performance loss,
 So it should be true on all lit objects, setting it to false is mostly only useful for debugging.

 Volumetric translucent shadows are useful for primitives with smoothly changing opacity like particles representing a volume, 
 But have artifacts when used on highly opaque surfaces.

 Whether to light this component and any attachments as a group.  This only has effect on the root component of an attachment tree.
 When enabled, attached component shadowing settings like bCastInsetShadow, bCastVolumetricTranslucentShadow, etc, will be ignored.
 This is useful for improving performance when multiple movable components are attached together.

 Composite the drawing of this component onto the scene after post processing (only applies to editor drawing) 
[/COMMENT]
[EXCERPT:bUseEditorCompositing]
[/EXCERPT:bUseEditorCompositing]

[COMMENT:none]

 Translucent objects with a lower sort priority draw behind objects with a higher priority.
 Translucent objects with the same priority are rendered from back-to-front based on their bounds origin.

 Ignored if the object is not translucent.  The default priority is zero.
 Warning: This should never be set to a non-default value unless you know what you are doing, as it will prevent the renderer from sorting correctly.  
 It is especially problematic on dynamic gameplay effects.
