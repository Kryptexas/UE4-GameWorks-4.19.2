## Overview

This example demonstrates the available Blend Modes that Decals can use. Different Blend Modes change the way the Decal affects the surface. This is set using the **Decal Blend Mode** property found within a Material.

There are 4 blend modes that decals can use:

* **Translucent** - Can use Diffuse, Metallic, Specular, Roughness, Emissive, Opacity, and Normal. 
* **Stain** - Is a modulate type blend with Diffuse and Opacity.
* **Normal** - Uses the Opacity and Normal channels and only affects the Normal map layer it is projecting on.
* **Emissive** - Uses Emissive and Opacity only.
