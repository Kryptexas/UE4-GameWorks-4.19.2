## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Description |
| --------| -------------|
| **Control+R** | Resets your view during gameplay. This can be helpful right when you begin gameplay, in case you launch the game before putting on your headset.|
| **Alt+Enter** | Toggle VR Mode. This makes the standalone game preview window full screen and stereo mode, and sends the game display to the headset.|

## Running A Standalone Game

To show your game on the VR headset, you can use **Play In Editor**'s standalone mode.  However, to get even better performance, you can run the game separately from the editor.

Using the console, or creating a shortcut for `UE4Editor.exe`, supply the following arguments:
	
	UE4Editor.exe [MyProject] [MyMap] -game

[REGION:tip]
Note that [MyProject] needs to be the absolute or relative path to your `.uproject` file.
