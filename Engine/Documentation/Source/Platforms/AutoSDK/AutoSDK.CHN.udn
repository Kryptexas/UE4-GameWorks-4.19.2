Manually installing Software Development Kits (SDKs) is supported; however, if you have to manage several SDK versions of a single platform, forcing you to build multiple versions of the same SDK, you'll want to use our **AutoSDK** feature, which is available in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). 
The main advantage of using [AutoSDK](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/Developer/DesktopPlatform/FPlatformInfo/index.html) is that you will enable [](Programming/UnrealBuildSystem) to automatically select the correct SDK version based on your project and branch. 
After using AutoSDK, you'll be able to set up your machine to compile your project for all supported platforms.

##Setting the Environment Variable

Before you can get started using AutoSDK, you'll have to set up the **UE_SDKS_ROOT** Environment Variable.

1.	Make note of the directory that holds all of the toolchains for your platforms (or a subset of those platforms). Your directory might look like `D:\YourPath\Host<Platform>`.

	[REGION:note]
	Generally, **AutoSDK** expects you to supply the `Host<Platform>` subdirectory, containing SDKs for target platforms (`Host<Platform>\TargetPlatform`). For example, the supplied subdirectory might look like `D:\YourPath\HostWin64\Linux_x64`.
	[/REGION]

1.	If needed, go ahead and add `//repo/YourDirectory` to your client workspace definition. As an example, in Perforce, you can add the directory to your [Client Spec](https://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.081/manuals/p4web/help/client.html).

	[REGION:note]
	Pay attention to the directory path's casing, because AutoSDK's path detection makes sure that case sensitive platforms don't get confused with pre-existing platforms that might have different casing.
	[/REGION]

	Now that you've added the directory to your client workspace definition, it's time to set the **UE_SDKS_ROOT** Environment Variable.

##End Result

At this point, you should have the **UE_SDKS_ROOT** Environment Variable defined the Unreal Build Tool (UBT) to take advantage of **AutoSDK**. 
Now, whenever UBT switches to an SDK, the **Setup** and **Unsetup** batch (or bash) script files will be able to install or reinstall the SDK.

###Using the Console

[REGION:tip]
If you're more comfortable using the **System Settings** window, feel free to jump to set the Environment Variable by [using the System Settings Window.](#Bookmark1)
[/REGION]

1.	To set the **UE_SDKS_ROOT** Environment Variable, open a **Command Prompt**.

1.	Now, enter the following command into the console: `setx UE_SDKS_ROOT D:\YourPath`.

###Using the System Settings Window

(#Bookmark1)

1.	To open the Windows **System** menu, press the **Windows+Pause/Break** keyboard combination.

1.	Click the **Advanced system settings** link to open the **System Properties** menu.

1.	Now, click the **Environment Variables...** button to open the **Environment Variables** menu.

1.	For this step, you can use either the **User variables** section or the **System variables** section of the **Environment Variables** menu. For illustrative purposes, go ahead and click the **New...** button in the **System variables** section of the **Environment Variables** menu.

1.	Enter `UE_SDKS_ROOT` in the **Variable name:** text field of the **New System Variable** menu.

1.	Now, enter the location of your directory path in the **Variable value:** field.

###Using the Terminal

1.	To set the **UE_SDKS_ROOT** Environment Variable, open a **Terminal**.

1.	Now, enter the following command into the terminal: `sudo -H gedit /etc/environment`.

	[REGION:note]
	We're using **gedit** as our text editor for this example; however, if you want to use another text editor to update the Environment Variable text file, feel free to use the editor of your choice.
	[/REGION]

1.	Type your **sudo** password to open the Environment Variable text file with **gedit**.

1.	To edit the newly opened Environment Variable text file, add `UE_SDKS_ROOT=YourPath` to the end of the file.

1.	After saving and closing the file, you'll need to restart your operating system in order for the changes to take effect.

1.	To verify your newly added environment variable, type `printenv` into the terminal.

###Using the Terminal

1.	To set the **UE_SDKS_ROOT** Environment Variable, open a **Terminal**.

1.	Now, enter the following command into the terminal: `sudo nano /etc/paths`.

	[REGION:note]
	We're using **nano** as our text editor for this example; however, if you want to use another text editor to update the Environment Variable text file, feel free to use the editor of your choice.
	[/REGION]

1.	To edit the newly opened Environment Variable text file, add `UE_SDKS_ROOT=YourPath` to the end of the file.

1.	After saving and closing the file, go ahead and open a new terminal.

1.	To verify your newly added environment variable, type `echo $PATH` into the terminal.
