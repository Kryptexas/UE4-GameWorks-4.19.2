Being able to debug your project on its target device is critical to tracking down performance issues and other possible project breaking errors. 
In the following section you will learn what tools are available to assist you in debugging your Gear VR projects and how to use them.

### Enabling Gear VR Developer Mode
Having the ability to view your Gear VR Project without having to use the Gear VR Headset can greatly speed up the time it takes to debug an issue by allowing you quick and easy access to things like Unreal's console. 
In the following sections we will cover how you can set up your Gear VR projects so that they can be viewed without the Gear VR Headset. 

[region:note]
Before you can do this you must make sure that you have some type of Gear VR application installed to your phone that has your device signature in it. 
This can be any kind of application, download or compiled.

1. You should now see a scan process happen and when completed you should see the **Developer Mode** toggle on the screen.

	![](T_GearVR_Dev_Mode_04.png)

1. Now you should be able to launch your Gear VR Project and have it display without having to use the Gear VR Headset.

	[region:tip]
	Be careful when enabling VR Developer mode as it can drastically drain your phone's battery as you are overriding any settings to turn off the Gear VR Headset when not in use.
	[/region]

1. If for any reason you need to disable VR Developer mode just slide the **Developer Mode** slider from **On** to **Off** and VR Developer mode will be disabled.

### Enabling the UE4 Console
The UE4 Console is a very powerful tool that allows you to look at and in some cases affect data that is currently being displayed in UE4. 
Accessing the UE4 console on Mobile devices requires a slightly different approach than what you might be used to on PC and is explained below.

[region:tip]
You can get a full list of available console commands by entering **DumpConsoleCommands** into the console while on a PC and Unreal will then list all available console commands in the console.
[/region]

1. First make sure that you have enabled Gear VR Developer mode on your phone. 
	This way you can launch your project and see it without having to use the Gear VR Headset which, if used, would prevent you from being able to touch your phone's screen.
	
	![](T_GearVR_Dev_Mode_04.png)

1. Next launch your Gear VR project by tapping on the projects icon to launch it. 
	When the project has been launched, you should see something looking like this on your phone.
	
	![](T_App_On_Phone.png)

1. With your Gear VR project now running, tap the phone's screen with **Four (4)** fingers at once to open up the Unreal Engine Console. 
	If done correctly you should see something like this on your phone's screen. 

	![](T_GearR_Open_Console.png)

1. Now input a console command you wish to use in the input box and then press the **Ok** button. 
	For this example we will use the **Stat Memory** command to see how much memory the project is using. 

	![](T_GearR_Input_Command.png)

1. Once the **Ok** button has been pressed, your project should now be displaying how much memory is being used and by what.

	![](T_GearR_Displaying_Memory.png)

1. When you are done debugging or if you just wish to clear the screen of debug information, you can input **Stat None** to clear the screen off all debug information.

	[region:tip]
	The best option for console debugging with the Gear VR Headset is to use a Bluetooth keyboard. This way you can use the console without having to remove the phone from the headset.
	[/region]

### Viewing Gear VR Debug Logs
Having the ability to view debug logs is of critical importance when developing any kind of 3D project. 
Debug logs can provide vital information and insight into why your project is not working and in some case's even make suggestions as to what you can do to fix things. 
In the following section we will go over what you need to do in order to get debug logs from your Smartphone.

[region:note]
Check out the official Android documentation for much more detailed information on all of various things you can do with [Logcat](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/logcat.html).
[/region]

1. First make sure that your Smartphone with the application you want to get debug information from is plugged into your PC via USB.

1. Next open up a Windows Command Shell by first pressing the **Windows Key + R** and then entering **CMD** in the **Run** dialogue box that is opened.
	Then press either the **Enter** key on your keyboard or just click on the **OK** button with your mouse. 
	 
	 ![](T_Open_CMD_Prompt.png)

1. Once the **OK** button has been toggled a Windows Command Line window like the following should now be displayed.
	
	![](T_Windows_CMD.png)

1. Now check to make sure that your PC can see your Smartphone by entering **ADB Devices** into the command line window and then press the **Enter** key to display devices attached to your PC.
	
	![](T_Windows_ADB_Devices.png)

	[region:tip]
	If you enter **ADB Devices** but do not see anything show up, make sure that you have gone through the [](Platforms/GearVR) setup section and installed / setup everything that is listed there and then try this step again. 
	[/region]

1. Now that you have verified that you can see your Smartphone in ADB Devices it is now time to get the log information from your phone. 
	But first we are going to clear the log cache to ensure that we are getting only current debug information and not old debug information. 
	To clear the log enter the following command.

		adb logcat -c
	![](T_ADB_Clear_Log.png)

1. With the log now cleared of old data, launch the application on your Smartphone and enter the following command to get the log information.
	
		adb logcat -s UE4 OVR VrApi VrLib VRSVC HmdInfo >logoutput.txt
	![](T_ADB_Get_Log.png)
 [region:note]
 To see the live output of the log, omit the **>logoutput.txt** part and all log updates will happen in the command line window.
 [/region]

1. To complete the log capture press **CTRL + C** on the keyboard and when completed you should now have a log file named,** logoutput.txt**, that is saved to your **Users** folder in Windows.
	![](T_ADB_Log_Location.png)

	[region:note]
	Data will still continue to be output to the log file while the command line window is open and running the ADB logcat command. To stop this all you have to do is press **CTRL + C** and data will stop being written to the log file.
	[/region] 

1. The information that is contained within the log file was generated from adding **UE4**, **OVR**,  **VrApi**, **VrLib**,**VRSVC**, and **HmdInfo** to the logcat command. 
	When you look at the log file that was created and search for anyone of those terms you will find all debug information related to those terms. 
	You can see an example of this in the image below, some of the terms used, **OVR**, **UE4**, **Vrapi**, and **VrApi** all show up in the log with information that is related to those terms.
	
	![](T_ADB_Log_Info.png)

If your Gear VR Project is not starting up for some reason, using the logcat command is a great way to see exactly where your project is failing and why. 
It also provides you with detailed information about the problem that can then be posted to the UE4 Forums or Answer Hub so that you can get help with the issue.

### Wireless Deploying & Debugging
Getting debug information or deploying to your Smartphone while it is in the Gear VR Headset is impossible due to the only USB port being used by the Gear VR Headset. 
However you can work around this issue by using your Smartphone's Wifi connection to send debug information to your development PC. 
You can even deploy projects in this manner however it is extremely slow when compared to using the USB cable. 
In the following section we will cover all you need to know about setting up your Smartphone so that it can send debug information and be deployed to over wifi.

[region:note]
Please note that in order for this to work you have to have your development PC and Galaxy Note 4 on the same network.
[/region]

1. Next open up a Windows Command Shell by first pressing the **Windows Key + R** and then entering **CMD** in the **Run** dialogue box that is opened.
	Then press either the **Enter** key on your keyboard or just click on the **OK** button with your mouse. 
	 
	 ![](T_Open_CMD_Prompt.png)

1. Once the **OK** button has been toggled a Windows Command Line window like the following should now be displayed.
	
	![](T_Windows_CMD.png)

1. Now enter the following command to see what your Smartphone's IP address is and make sure to take note of it. The IP address you want to use is the one that comes after **inet**.
	
		adb shell ip -f inet addr show wlan0
	
	![](T_ADB_Phone_IP.png)

1. Next enter the following command to change the network connection to **TCP** and set the port to listen to.

		adb tcpip 5555
	
	![](T_ADB_Set_Port.png)

1. Once the port has been set, it is now time to connect to the Smartphone. To do this all you need to do is enter the following command and press the Enter key.
	
		adb connect 10.3.31.133 - Replace with your devices IP Address.
		
1. You should now see a message that says **connected to** and the IP address of your device.
	
	![](T_ADB_Connected.png)

1. To make sure you are connected over Wifi, enter **adb devices** into the command line window and press the Enter key and you will now see that in the **List of devices attached** the IP Address used above is now the only attached device.

	![](T_ADB_Attached_IP.png)

With your Smartphone and PC now connected to one another via the network you can now begin to get debug information from your Smartphone or even deploy projects to your phone without having to use the USB cable. 
However keep in mind that deploying to your Smartphone from your PC over the network is four to five times slower than using the USB cable.

### Return to Wired Deploying & Debugging
1. To return to using the USB cable for debugging and deployment, input the following command into the command window.
	
		adb usb
