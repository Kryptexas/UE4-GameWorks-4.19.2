Before we can start to build the Global Menu HUD we first need to create a new HUD Actor so that the Blueprint code that we create has a location to be stored. 
In the following section of this Quick Start we will go over how to create a new HUD to your Gear VR project.

1. First need to create a new HUD by **Right - Clicking** in the **Content Browser** and then selecting the **Blueprint Class** option from the **Create Basic Asset** section.
