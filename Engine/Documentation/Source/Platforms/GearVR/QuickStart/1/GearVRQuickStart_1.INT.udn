With the release of Unreal Engine 4.8, setting up a project that works with the Samsung Gear VR Headset is no different than setup than a normal UE4 project. 
In the following section we will go over everything you need to know in order to create a new project that will work with the Gear VR headset.

[REGION:warning]
If you are using UE4 version 4.7 you will need to create your project as a C++ project and not a Blueprint project.
In UE4 version 4.8 and later you do not have to do this and can use either C++ or Blueprints for your projects.

1. First make sure that you have UE4 version **4.7.4** or later downloaded and installed on your development PC. 
You can get UE4 version **4.7.4** or later from the [Unreal Engine Launcher](http://tinyurl.com/oawb7x2) or from [Github](https://www.unrealengine.com/ue4-on-github). 

	[Region:note]
	If you are using the [Github](https://www.unrealengine.com/ue4-on-github) version of UE4 to run the **Setup.Bat** file before going any further to ensure that you have the proper files downloaded to your development PC.

1. Next select the **First Person Template** as the template to be used and make sure to change the following options.
	* **Mobile / Tablet**
	* **Scalable 3D / 2D** 
	* Also make sure to not include the **Starter Content** to help reduce project size.

1. Finally give the project a location to be saved to and a name. The name for this example the project name will be **GearVR_QS**. Once everything has been completed press the green **Create Project** button to create the project.
