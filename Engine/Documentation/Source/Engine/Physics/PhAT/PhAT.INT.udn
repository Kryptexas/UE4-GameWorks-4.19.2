The **Physics Asset Editor** is an integrated editor that is part of the [Animation Editors](Engine/Animation/Persona/Modes) in Unreal Engine 4. It is specifically designed to manipulate
**Physics Assets** for [Skeletal Meshes](Engine/Content/Types/SkeletalMeshes).

A **Physics Asset** is used to define the physics and collision used by a Skeletal Mesh. These contain a set of rigid bodies and constraints that make up a single ragdoll, which is not
limited to humanoid ragdolls. They can be used for any physical simulation using bodies and constraints. Because only a single Physics Asset is allowed for a Skeletal Mesh, they can 
be turned on or off for many Skeletal Mesh components.

A Physics Asset can be set up for any Skeletal Mesh for simulation. These are two examples of their usage; a humanoid character and the Buggy from Epic's demo Vehicle Game.


## Creating Physics Assets

There a couple of ways that Physics Assets can be created for your Skeletal Meshes:

* On import by having **Create Physics Asset** enabled.

* By creating a Physics Asset using the **Content Browser** and selecting a Skeletal Mesh to use.

	The first time the Physics Asset is selected, a window to set the how bodies and constraints should be generated will open:

## Opening the Physics Asset Editor

The Physics Asset Editor can be opened in a couple of different ways:

* By double-clicking the Physics Asset in the **Content Browser**.

* Or by selecting the **Physics** tab in the [Animation Editors](Engine/Animation/Persona/Modes) selection tabs.

	The down **arrow** next to the **Physics** tab can be used to select any Physics Asset located in the Content Browser that is using the currently opened Skeleton.
