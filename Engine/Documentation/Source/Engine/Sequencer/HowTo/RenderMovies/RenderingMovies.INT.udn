Once you have created your cinematic sequence (or even during your production process as part of daily reviews), you may want to render it out as a movie file that you can share with others. The **Render Movie** option in Sequencer enables you to share your movie with others as an `.avi` file that will play with most media players. In addition to rendering as a movie file, you can render your cinematic as an Image Sequence or render out [Custom Render Passes](Engine/Sequencer/Workflow/CustomRenderPass) that you can use in an external application to finalize your scene.

In this example, we create a sample cinematic and render it out as a movie while outlining some of the options that are available as part of the rendering process:

	![](RenderMovie_04.png)

	We will shoot a sample scene where the camera pushes in on our the Character in the Level for a close-up shot. 

1.	In the **Sequencer Editor** move to frame **150**, then move the Camera in the Level to a new location and press the **S** key to add a keyframe.

	The camera will now move from our first keyframe to our second keyframe, pushing in on the Character. 

1.	In the **Sequencer Editor**, click the **Render Movie** button.

	In addition to rendering your sequence out as a movie, you can also render it as an Image Sequence or render out Custom Render Passes. 

1.	Under **General**, choose an **Output Directory** to save your cinematic to, then click **Capture Movie**.

	If prompted to **Save** your content after selecting **Capture Movie**, click **Save** or **Don't Save** to continue. Selecting **Cancel** will abort the rendering process.

## End Result

After the capture process, you will have a video file of your cinematic sequence (below is our rendered-out cinematic).

**Burn-ins** are overlays that are embedded with your video, generally to provide internal information about the frame being shown. You can add burn-ins to your video, including [custom burn-ins](Engine/Sequencer/HowTo/CustomBurnIns) that you create, by enabling the **Use Burn In** option.

This can be useful if you are doing reviews of a cinematic, as it will display timecode information as well as shot names and any other custom information you want to provide.
