The **Sequence Recorder** allows you to capture specified Actors during gameplay that are then saved as a new **Level Sequence** and can be edited inside **Sequencer**. 
This is useful for quickly capturing content for scenes as you can take a playable character, perform some actions during gameplay while recording with the Sequence Recorder then take that data into Sequencer and create a cinematic around it. 

In this example, we will use the Sequence Recorder to record our playable character's movement which we can then edit. 


## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content Enabled**. 
[/REGION]

1.	From the **Menu Bar** under **Window**, select **Sequence Recorder**. The Sequence Recorder window will automatically open. There are some options under **Sequence Recording** which will determine how (and where) the new Level Sequence asset will be saved. You can choose to record Actors that are spawned (such as particle effects, other characters, etc.), determine the naming convention and save location, and change other settings like the duration to record or delay before starting to record.

1.	From the Main Editor Toolbar, click the **Play** button to start a Play in Editor session. 

1.	Press **Shift+F1** to gain mouse control once inside the game. 

1.	On the **Sequence Recorder** window, click the **Add** button.

1.	Click on the new recording, then for **Actor to Record** click the drop-down and select **ThirdPersonCharacter**. This is where we specify which Actor to target recording around before starting the recording process.

1.	Click the **Record** button. After 4 seconds (which is the **Record Delay** option under the Sequence Recording section), the record process will start.

	[REGION:note]
	When clicking the **Record** button, all Actors in the list that are set to be tracked will also be recorded.

1.	Use the **WASD** and **Spacebar** keys to move the character around and jump, then press **ESC** when done. Below is the sequence we recorded. However, if you have a character that can attack or perform other actions, feel free to use that.

1.	Inside the **Content Browser** a new folder will be created containing assets related to the recorded sequence. When recording is complete, a **Level Sequence** asset containing your cniematic data as well as an **Animation Sequence** containing your animation data will be created.

## End Result

You can open the **RecordedSequence** asset and begin editing it as you would a normal Level Sequence. Below is our recorded sequence to which we could add cameras and a [**Camera Cuts**](Engine/Sequencer/HowTo/TracksCameraCut) track to provide multiple angles, music, effects or anything else we wanted. We could even take this sequence and embed it in another sequences as part of a [**Shots Track**](Engine/Sequencer/HowTo/TracksShot).
