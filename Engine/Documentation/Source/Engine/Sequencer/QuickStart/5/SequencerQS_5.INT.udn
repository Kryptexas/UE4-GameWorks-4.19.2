In the previous steps, we created our shots. 
In this step we tie them together using the **Shot Track** which enables us to add Level Sequences along the timeline for playback.
We also create a **Take** of one of those Shots, which enables us to create a variant of that shot or use it as an additional Shot in the cinematic. 
At the end of this step, you will have your own multi-shot cinematic! 

## Steps

1. In the **Content Browser**, open the **Master** Level Sequence. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_1.png)

1. Inside the Level Sequence, click the **Track** button and select the **Shot Track**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_2.png)

1. Click the **+ Shot** button and add **Shot01** to the track. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_3.png)

1. Move the Timeline Marker to frame **150** then add **Shot02** to the **Shot Track**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_4.png) 

	You will notice that **Shot02** extends past the red maker (which is the end of playback range) and is grayed out and is not being evaluated for playback. 
	
1. Click the **Playback Options** button and select **Keep Playback Range in Section Bounds**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_5.png)

	This will automatically push the Timeline End Marker out for us anytime we add content, ensuring that everything is within playback evaluation range. 

1. Left-click and drag **Shot02** down to a new track within the **Shot Track**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_6.png)

	You can drag shots around to arrange the playback order or for organization purposes. 
	A typical best practice is to alternate between tracks within a Shot Track to illustrate where cuts occur rather than leaving them all on the same single track.
	Below we have an example with multiple shots that are staggered and alternate between tracks, which makes the distinction of where the cut appears, easier to spot.  

	![](ShotCuts.png)

	In the example below, we have the same number of shots without using an additional track to stagger each of our shots and the cuts are not as easily identifiable. 

	![](ShotCutsB.png)

1. Click the **Camera Lock** toggle button to lock the camera to the **Shot Track**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_7.png) 

	Like the **Camera Cuts** Track, the **Camera Lock** button on the Shot Track will only affect the Cinematic Viewport.

1. Right-click on **Shot02** and select the **New Take** option. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_8.png)

	**Takes** are a way to quickly create variations of a particular Shot in your cinematic. 

1. A **Duplicate Asset As** window will appear, click **Save**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_9.png)

	[REGION:note]
	Takes are automatically named. You can change the auto naming convention in the [](Engine/UI/ProjectSettings) under **Level Sequences**.  
	[/REGION]

1.	Right-click on the newly created Shot and choose **New Take** again. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_10.png)

	[REGION:note]
	When creating a Take, it does not delete the Level Sequence but creates a duplicate of it which you can then alter. 
	Currently, when creating a Take for the first time, it replaces the existing Shot with the new Take (the original Shot still exists in the Content Browser but is not listed as a "Take" in the Takes Menu). 
	[/REGION]

1.	Right-click on the newly created shot and highlight **Takes**. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_11.png)

	We are currently using **Take 3** in our cinematic. We can switch to Take 2 by selecting it from this menu. 

1.	Double-click on the **Shot0002_003** inside Sequencer to open it, then select and delete all the keyframes. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_12.png)

	We are going to supply new keyframes from this Take and new camera movement. 

1.	Move the Camera in front of the Character's face, then in Sequencer for the Camera, add a key for **Transform** by pressing the **S** key. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_14.png)

1.	In the **Details** panel for the camera, use the **Eye Dropper** and select the Character then add a keyframe for the new **Manual Focus Distance** value. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_15.png)

1.	Move to the end of the Sequence, then move the Camera away from the Character and press the **S** key to add a key for the new **Transform** value. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_16.png)

	For this take, we will leave the Camera out of focus as it pulls away from the Character. 

1.	Click the **Master** breadcrumb to return to the **Master** Track, lock the Viewport to the **Shots** Track and play your scene.

	You can also right-click on the second shot and change to a different Take. 

1.	Return to the **Content Browser** and drag your **Master** Level Sequence into the Level. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_17.png)

1.	In the **Details** panel for the **Master** Level Sequence, enable the **Auto Play** option. 

	![](SequencerQS_5_18.png)

	When you play in the Editor, this will automatically load and start playing your **Master** Level Sequence which includes your two shots. 

1.	Click the **Play in Editor** button. 


## End Result

You now have a two-shot cinematic, however, you can use different **Takes** from the Take Menu.

You can re-arrange the Shots by dragging them to new locations on the Shot Track or add a Take as an additional Shot, giving you three Shots. 
While this is only a small fraction of what is possible with Sequencer, it highlights some of the core aspects of the tool that you can use to craft your scenes. 

In the next and final step, there are some "On Your Own" challenges you can attempt to add to this scene and links to additional documentation.
