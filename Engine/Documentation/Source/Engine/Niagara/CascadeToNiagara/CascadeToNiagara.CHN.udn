While both Cascade and Niagara can be used to make visual effects (VFX) inside Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) the manner in which you use Cascade to create and adjust visual effects versus how you use Niagara to create and adjust visual effects is vastly different. In the following document, we will take a look at how to transition from Cascade to Niagara to make all of your visual effects. The reason for creating this new tool is to put more power into the hands of the artist to create additional functionality without the help of a programmer. We take some inspiration from the movie FX tools and try to make the system as adaptable and flexible as possible while keeping usability high and accommodating the 90% use cases.

## Niagara Overview

Niagara is Unreal Engine's next-generation visual effects system. It's a complete replacement for Cascade, with which it will coexist for a period unit Niagara functionally is deemed to fully superseded Cascades functionality. 

## Why is Niagara Better Than Cascade

The fundamental power of Niagara is predominantly in the ability to share arbitrary particle data in whatever way the user sees fit. This helps to enable users to script their own behaviors rather than requiring code intervention to create new hard-coded features. In Cascade, particle simulations are controlled by hard-coded modules, each providing a specific set of functionality to modify particle attributes. In contrast, Niagara simulation is controlled by node graphs that artist can create and edit.

One of the other reasons Niagara's is superior to Cascade is that Niagara's node graphs are compiled to bytecode that is run in a very low overhead interpreter, resulting in very high performance even on CPU simulations. GPU simulations are planned, and it is expected to be transparent - with a few caveats, any emitter should be able to be simulated on CPU or GPU based on user choice.

## Cascade & Niagara UI 

When you first open up Niagara, the User Interface(UI) will look completely different than Cascade. However, if you take a close look, you will begin to notice that the Niagara interface does share some of the following similarities to Cascade. 

* Realtime 3D viewport to visualize effects while they are being created. 

* Curves Editor for adjusting R, G, B and Alpha values.

* Details Panel for adjusting various properties.

## Niagara Emitters & Systems 

One of the biggest differences between Cascade and Niagara is how you build emitters. When using Cascade emitters were built as a self-contained unit. While this made the emitters easy to place and spawn, it also made it hard to share behavior between different emitter or make updates as everything had to be done manually.  Niagara changes all of this by giving visual effect artist the ability to control, add or modify any part of a visual effects behavior right down to the pixel level. To accomplish Niagara particle systems have been broken up into the following two parts.

 * **Niagara Emitters:** This is a single visual effect that will be combined with other Niagara Emitters to make a Niagara System. If we are making a fire effect, the Niagara Emitters would be each of the different elements that make up the fire effect like the smoke, fire, distortion, and embers.

 * **Niagara Systems:** This contains all of the needed effects that make this up. Continuing with our fire example, this would be the completed fire effect that contains the smoke, fire, distortion, and embers.
