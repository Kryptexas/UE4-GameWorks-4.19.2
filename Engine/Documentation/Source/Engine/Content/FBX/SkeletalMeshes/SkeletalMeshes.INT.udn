[EXCERPT:FBX_SkeletalMeshes]
_Skeletal Mesh_ support in the FBX import pipeline provides a streamlined workflow for getting animated meshes 
from 3D applications into Unreal for use in games. In addition to the meshes being imported, animations and 
morph targets can be transferred using the FBX format all within the same file if desired. Also, the textures 
(diffuse and normal map only) used in the materials applied to those meshes in the 3D application will be 
imported and materials will be automatically created and applied to the imported meshes.
[/EXCERPT:FBX_SkeletalMeshes]

Features supported for importing Skeletal Meshes using FBX:


* [Materials including textures](#Materials)
* [Animations](#Animations)
* [Morph Targets](#MorphTargets)
* Multiple UV sets
* Smoothing groups
* [Vertex colors](#VertexColors)
* [LODs](#SkeletalMeshLODs)


[REGION:note]
Currently, only a single animation for each _Skeletal Mesh_ can be imported in a single file. Multiple morph 
targets can be transferred for a _Skeletal Mesh_ in one file, though.

## General Setup



### Single Mesh vs Multi-Part Mesh

_Skeletal Meshes_ can be comprised of a single, contiguous mesh or they can be made up of several separate meshes 
all skinned to the same skeleton. 

![multipart.png](multipart.png)(w:750 convert:false)

Using multiple meshes makes it possible to LOD individual parts differently as well as exporting parts separately 
for use in modular character systems. There is no performance penalty for creating your _Skeletal Meshes_ this way. 
The individual parts are all combined when being imported into Unreal Editor.


### Rigging

Rigging refers to the binding of a mesh to a skeletal hierarchy of bones/joints. This allows the bones/joints of the underlying skeleton to influence the vertices of the mesh, deforming it as they move.

For Maya, you can find the [Animation & Rigging Tools](Engine/Content\Tools\MayaRiggingTool) in your UE4 Install Path\Engine\Extras\Maya_AnimationRiggingTools\MayaTools. These tools include a very in depth character rigging and animation solution for Maya.

[EXCERPT:maxSkeleton]
How you go about creating skeletal hierarchies in 3dsMax is up to you. You may use the standard _Bones Tools_ as 
they work quite well, or create your own hierarchy of objects to allow for completely custom geometry and controls. 
There are many ways to skin a cat (pardon the pun) and tons of tutorials out there that show how to create animation 
rigs for game characters. You can also refer to the 3dsMax Help for complete details on how the tools work.

![max_rig.png](max_rig.png)(w:769)
[/EXCERPT:maxSkeleton]


[EXCERPT:mayaSkeleton]
In Maya, you will generally use the _Joint Tool_ to create the skeleton for your _Skeletal Mesh_. Again, there are 
endless tutorials on using this tool and creating rigs in Maya. The Maya help is also a good source of information 
on the subject.

[EXCERPT:maxBind]
In 3dsMax, the mesh(es) must be bound to the skeleton using the _Skin_ modifier. The process is the same whether the 
_Skeletal Mesh_ consists of a single complete mesh or is made up of multiple mesh parts.


1. Select the mesh to be bound.   

    ![max_skin_1.png](max_skin_1.png)(w:744)

1. Add a _Skin_ modifier from the _Modifier List_.   

    ![max_skin_2.jpg](max_skin_2.jpg)(w:175 h:202)

1. In the Parameters rollout of the _Skin_ modifier, click the ![skin_add_button.jpg](skin_add_button.jpg) button to add the bones that will influence the mesh. The **Select Bones** window will open.   

    ![max_skin_3.jpg](max_skin_3.jpg)(w:468 h:513)

1. Select the bones in the **Select Bones** window and click the **Select** button to add the bones.   

    ![max_skin_4.jpg](max_skin_4.jpg)(w:468 h:513)

1. The bones are now displayed in the _Bones_ list of the modifier.   

    ![max_skin_5.jpg](max_skin_5.jpg)(w:156 h:182)

1. Now you can adjust the weights of the vertices of the mesh for each bone to determine which vertices are influenced by which bones and to what degree. This can be done using envelopes, directly entering the weights for the vertices, or whichever method you prefer.   

    ![max_skin_6.png](max_skin_6.png)(w:744)
[/EXCERPT:maxBind]


[EXCERPT:mayaBind]
In Maya, the mesh(es) are bound to the skeleton using the _Smooth Bind_ command. The process is the same whether 
the _Skeletal Mesh_ consists of a single complete mesh or is made up of multiple mesh parts.


1. Select the mesh(es) to be bound.   
	
	[REGION:lightbox]
	[![maya_skin_1.png](maya_skin_1.png)(w:769)](maya_skin_1.png)
	[/REGION]
	    
1. **Shift** + Select the root joint of the skeleton.   

    [REGION:lightbox]
	[![maya_skin_2.png](maya_skin_2.png)(w:769)](maya_skin_1.png)
	[/REGION]

1. Select _Smooth Bind_ from the _Skin > Bind Skin_ menu.   

    ![maya_skin_3.jpg](maya_skin_3.jpg)(w:287 h:130)

1. Now you can adjust the weights of the vertices of the mesh for each joint to determine which vertices are influenced by which bones and to what degree. This can be done using the _Paint Skin Weights Tool_ or whichever method you prefer.

### Pivot Point

The pivot point of the mesh in Unreal Engine determines the point around which any transformations (translation, 
rotation, scale) will be performed. 

![pivot.png](pivot.png)(w:769)

The pivot point of a _Skeletal Mesh_ is always located at the root bone/joint of the skeleton. This means it does 
not matter where the root of the skeleton is located within the scene. It will be as though it is at the origin 
(0,0,0) when exporting from a 3D modeling application.

![pivot_root.png](pivot_root.png)(w:769)


### Triangulation

Meshes in Unreal Engine must be triangulated as the graphics hardware only deals with triangles.

![tris.jpg](tris.jpg)(w:744 h:382)

There are several ways you can ensure your mesh is triangulated.


* Model the mesh with only tris - best solution, provides the most control over the end result.
* Triangulate the mesh in the 3D app - good solution, allows cleanup and modification before export.
* Allow the importer to triangulate the mesh - okay solution, allows no cleanup but can work for simple meshes.
* Allow the FBX exporter to triangulate the mesh - okay solution, allows no cleanup but can work for simple meshes.


**Note:** Allowing the FBX exporter to triangulate the mesh results in completely random smoothing when Split Non-Matching 
Triangles is checked. Importing an FBX-triangulated mesh back into Maya and re-exporting shows proper smoothing. 

It will always be best to manually triangulate the mesh in the 3D application, controlling the direction and placement of 
edges. Automatic triangulation can lead to undesirable results.

![tris_bad.jpg](tris_bad.jpg)


### Creating Normal Maps

Normal maps can be created for your meshes directly inside of most modeling applications by creating both a low-res render mesh and a high-res detail mesh.

![SideBySide.jpg](SideBySide.jpg)

The geometry of the high-res detail mesh is used to generate the normals for the normal map. Epic uses a workflow internally that introduces XNormal into the process and generally results in much better normals when rendering inside of Unreal Engine 4. For details on this process, see [](Engine/Content/Types/Textures/NormalMaps/Creation).


### Materials

The materials applied to meshes modeled in external applications will be exported along with the mesh and then imported into 
Unreal. This streamlines the process as textures do not need to be imported separately in Unreal Ed, materials do not need 
to be created and applied, etc. The import process is capable of performing all of these actions when using the FBX pipeline.

These materials also need to be set up in a specific way, especially when the mesh has multiple materials or the order of the 
materials on the mesh is important (i.e. for character models where material 0 needs to be the body and material 1 needs to be 
the head).

For complete details of setting up materials for export, see the [FBX Material Pipeline](Engine/Content/FBX/Materials) page.

(#VertexColors)


### Vertex Colors

Vertex colors (one set only) for _Skeletal Meshes_ can be transferred using the FBX pipeline. No special setup is necessary.

![vertex_color.jpg](vertex_color.jpg)(w:769 h:376)

(#ExportMesh)


## Export Mesh from 3D App


_Skeletal Meshes_ can be exported individually or multiple meshes can be exported to a single FBX file. The import pipeline will separate multiple _Skeletal Meshes_ into multiple assets within the destination package.

	[REGION:lightbox]
	[![](CharacterInPersona.png)(w:600)](CharacterInPersona.png)
	[/REGION]


(#MeshLODs)
## Skeletal Mesh LODs


_Skeletal Meshes_ can make use of levels of detail (LODs) in-game in order to limit the impact of meshes as they get farther 
from the camera. Generally, this means each level of detail will have a reduced number of tris, simpler skeleton, and, perhaps, 
a simpler material (or materials) applied to it.

The FBX pipeline can be used to export/import these LOD meshes.


### LOD Setup

In general, LODs are handled by creating models of varying complexity going from the full-detail base mesh to the lowest-detail 
LOD mesh. These should all be aligned and occupying the same space with the same pivot point and should all be skinned to the 
same skeleton. It is also possible for _Skeletal Meshes_ to be made up of multiple individual meshes within the 3D application. 
Each of these parts can have LODs independent of the rest of the mesh. This means that some parts can have simplified versions 
in different LODs while other parts continue to use higher detail versions. Each LOD mesh can have completely different materials 
assigned, including different amounts of materials. This means the base mesh could use multiple materials to give the desired 
amount of detail up close, but the lower-detail meshes could use a single material since details will be less noticeable.

#### Multi-Part LODs

Setting up LODs for multi-part _Skeletal Meshes_ is almost identical to setting up LODs for a full mesh with the exception that 
each individual part that has LODs will have an LOD group created for it. The process for setting up those individual LOD groups 
is identical to the process outlined above.
