Description:An overview of the Nvidia and AMD tools available for the creation of Cubemaps.

Building a cubemap is very easy if you have the right tools. This document covers some useful tools used to generate cubemaps.


### NVIDIA Texture Tools for Adobe Photoshop

One of the more common tools available is the NVIDIA Texture Tools plug-in for Adobe Photoshop. This tool set allows for the creation of DDS textures, cubemaps, and normal maps. 

The plug-in can be acquired from [NVIDIA](http://developer.nvidia.com/content/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop).

[REGION:note]
	At this time, the NVidia plug-in will produce errors when trying to export a 16-bit floating point (HDR) cubemap. Those wanting to create such a map might consider the unsupported ATI Cubemap Generator.

### AMD CubeMapGen

Alternatively, you may use AMD CubeMapGen to produce cubemaps. This tool is capable of producing 16-bit floating point cubemaps. There are, however, some caveats to consider:

1. This tool has officially reached the end of its life and is no longer supported by AMD.
2. The tool uses a Y-Up world orientation, meaning that you will have to consider some axis shifting to make maps that work well in Unreal.


The tool is available for download directly from [AMD](http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/archive/legacy-cpu-gpu-tools/cubemapgen/).

### Other Tools

Epic Games has also made use of other tools to create the cubemap image, including:

1. HDR Light Studio, available at [http://www.hdrlightstudio.com/](http://www.hdrlightstudio.com/)

2. VUE can output a panoramic HDR image, this is useful for HDRs that contain skies. [http://www.e-onsoftware.com/products/vue/vue_10.5_xstream/](http://www.e-onsoftware.com/products/vue/vue_10.5_xstream/)

3. If rendering out of Mental Ray, you can use the Wrap Around (lume) lens shader.

4. Light probe images can be purchased from a variety of websites.
