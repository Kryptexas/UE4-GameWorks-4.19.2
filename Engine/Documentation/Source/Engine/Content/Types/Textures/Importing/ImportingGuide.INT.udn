Description:Guide to importing an image file into Unreal Engine as a texture asset.

[TOC(start:2)]

This document covers the process of importing textures into Unreal Engine 4.

For more information on the **Content Browser**, see the [Content Browser Reference](Engine/Content/Browser).


### Importing Images - Textures

To import your image texture, go to the **Content Browser** and click **Import**. Find your file and click **Open**.

Alternatively, you can click and drag images directly into the **Content Browser**.

The following Texture formats are supported:

[EXCERPT:SupportedTextureFormats]
* .bmp
* .float
* .pcx
* .png
* .psd
* .tga
* .jpg
* .dds - Cubemap Texture (32bits/Channel, 8.8.8.8 ARGB 32 bpp, unsigned) See [Cubemap Tools](Engine/Content/Types/Textures\Cubemaps\CubemapTools) for more information.
* .hdr - Cubemap Texture (LongLat unwrap)

### LOD Groups

For every texture imported into the engine, it gets assigned a default LODGroup, which is used by the engine to determine what mip level of the texture will be rendered based on the current detail levels specified in the .ini files. 

Once the texture is imported, you can double-click it to open the texture in the Texture Editor tab. This exposes the LODBias property. This setting is used to offset the LOD Group setting by its value.

Keep in mind that any texture you import into the engine has to be a power of 2. Some examples include 512x512, 1024x1024, 512x1024, 2048x256, ect.

Example:

4096 square texture, assigned to TEXTUREGROUP_WORLD.

LODBias of 0, group is set to highest, texture will load highest miplevel (4096).

LODBias of 0, group is set to drop 2 miplevels, texture will load third miplevel (1024).

LODBias of 1, group is set to drop 2 miplevels, texture will load fourth miplevel (512).

LODBias of -2, group is set to drop 2 miplevels, texture will load highest miplevel (4096).

The LOD Group settings exist in the game-specific ini (e.g. ExampleGame.ini).  Manipulating these group settings (and creating your own groups) will allow you to control how much detail is used in particular asset types.

### Animating Images - Flipbook Textures

A Flipbook Texture is a series of images that are calculated as a single texture, thus allowing you to sample a variety of image series or animation in your materials.

To create a Flipbook Texture, simply import multiple textures, and check the _Flipbook_ property.
