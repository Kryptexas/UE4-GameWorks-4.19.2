Materials are assets applied to meshes, contributing to a scene's visual aesthetic.

There are a few ways to create and edit materials for your UE4 project; however, we'll focus on using the **Material Editor**.

## Creating a New 'Rock' Material

1.	Navigating to your **Content Browser**, click **Add New** and select **Material** (pictured below).

1.	Name your material **'Rock'**.

1.	Your **'Rock' Material** is now ready to be used.

1.	Double-clicking the **'Rock' Material** will open the [Material Editor](Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor "%Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor:description%") (pictured below).

	Read our [Material - How To](Engine/Rendering/Materials/HowTo "%Engine/Rendering/Materials/HowTo:description%") documentation if you want to learn more about working with material nodes.

[REGION:tip]
*Size your textures using powers of two.*

Now using what you know, create a new **Material** similar to this graph:

There is nothing fancy set on the Main Material node, this is just a simple plastic Material. 

Add the _Basic_Asset1_ to the level and apply the Material to it and update the Material to add a "Brick" Normal Map Texture.

## Creating New Material with the Material Editor

1.	Navigate to your **Content Browser**, click **Add New**, and select **Material** (pictured below).

	_Alternatively, you can **Right-click** in an empty space within the **Content Browser.**_
	
1.	Enter a name for your newly created **Material**.

	_If you'd like to rename your material, Right-click on the asset and select Rename._

1.	**Double-clicking** the Material will open the Material Editor [__Material Editor__](Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor "%Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor:description%") (pictured below).

	_At this point, the Material Editor only contains the **Main Material Node.**_

You've just created new materials for your project using two methods:

* Using **existing textures** to create new materials.
* Working in the **Material Editor** to create new materials.
