%Steps%

At this point, you should have created a new material and opened the **Material Editor** (pictured below).

[/REGION]

You can define a material's color, shininess, transparency, and much more in the [Material Editor](Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor "%Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor:description%"). You're now ready to edit the **'Rock' Material** you created.

## Editing your 'Rock' Material

1.	Select the **Main Material Node** in the center of the **Material Graph**. The **Material Editor** will highlight the node for you when you select it (pictured below).

	![](newMainNode.png)

	_It is the only node in the graph (named after your material)._

1.	Inside the **Details Panel**, change the **Shading Model** from **Default Lit** to **Subsurface**.
	
	![](selectSubsurface.png)

1.	The **Subsurface Shading Model** enables two more pins in the **Main Material Node**: **Opacity** and **Subsurface Color** (pictured below).
	
	![](newMorePins.png)

1.	Now is the time to get your textures into the Graph. Hold the **' T '** key and left-click inside the Editor's Graph area. A **Texture Sample Node** should appear inside the graph.
	
	![](TextureSample.png)

1.	You'll want at least 2 textures. Repeat Step 4 until your graph looks like the image below.
	
	![](newTextureSampleNodes.png)

1.	Select one of the **Texture Sample Nodes** and locate the **Details Panel** under the **Material Expression Texture Base** category (pictured below). 
	
	![](matExpressionTextureBase.png)

	Under the texture property, left-click the pull down menu labeled **'None'** and select the color texture named **T_Rock_04_D**.

	[REGION:note]
		_You can also use the search field to locate the texture asset by entering **'T_Rock_04_D'** in the search field._
	[/REGION]

1.	Repeat Step 6 for the other **Texture Sample Node**, making sure to select the normal map texture named **T_Rock_04_n**.
	
	![](newBothTexturesSelected.png)

	_The Material Graph should resemble the image pictured above._

1.	Connect the **T_Rock_04_D** Texture Sample's **Color pin (white)** to the Rock Material's **Base Color pin**.
	
	![](newConnectColorPin.png)

	_The newly connected **white pin** (pictured above) contains the texture's color channels._

1.	Connect the **T_Rock_04_n** Texture Sample's **Normal pin (white)** to the Rock Material's **Normal pin**.
	
	![](newConnectNormalPin.png)

	_The newly connected **white pin** (pictured above) contains information for the texture's normal map_.

1.	The **Preview** should look similar to the image pictured below.
	
	![](newPreview_DN.png)

1.	Hold the **' 1 '** key and left-click in the **Graph Panel** to create three (**3**) **Constant** nodes.
	
	![](Constants.jpg)

	_The **Constant Node** (pictured above) is a modifiable scalar float variable._

1.	Hold the **' 3 '** key and left-click in the Graph Panel to create one (__1__) **Constant3Vector**.
	
	![](Constant3.jpg)

	_The **Constant3Vector** node (pictured above) is a modifiable vector corresponding to color without an alpha channel._
	[REGION:note]
		Read our [Constant Expression](Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Constant "%Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Constant:description%") documentation if you want to learn more about working with constant expressions.
	[/REGION]

1.	Your nodes should be arranged so that connections can be easily made without wires crossing or sliding beneath each other (pictured below).
	
	![](newMatConstantsAdded.png)

1.	Connect all of the **Constant** and **Constant3Vector** nodes to corresponding pins in the **'Rock' Material Main Node** (pictured below).
	
	![](newAllNodesConnectedNoVal.png)

1.	Change the values of each **Constant** and **Constant3Vector** by updating their **Value** parameter in the **Details** panel.
	
	* **Specular Value** = 0.0
	* **Roughness Value** = 0.8
	* **Opacity Value** = 0.95
	* **Subsurface Color** = Red(1,0,0)
	
	![](newAllConnectedAllAdjusted.png)

1.	The **Preview** should look similar to the image pictured below.
	
	![](newPreviewAll.png)

	[REGION:warning]
		Make sure to save your material before exiting the **Material Editor**.

You're almost done! You've just used the **Material Editor** to edit your **'Rock' Material**.
