[REGION:note]
**If you don't have meshes to import, we've got you covered.**
[/REGION]

1. Download sample assets from the following link:
	* [__Sample Assets__](Engine/Content/QuickStart/1/2/QuickStartSampleAssets.zip "Quick Start Sample Assets Download Link")

1. Extract the downloaded assets to a location on your computer.

1. Drag **Basic_Asset1** and **Basic_Asset2** into the **Content** folder of your project's directory (pictured below).

	![](ExplorerImport.jpg)

1. Entering the Editor, the **FBX Import Options** dialog box appears. Clicking **Import** or **Import All** will add your mesh to the Project.

	![](FBX_ImportOptions.jpg)

1. Now that you've imported your asset, drag-and-drop the mesh from the **Content Browser** into your level.

Now that you've added meshes to your level, you're ready to add another important asset: Images!

On this page, we will take the **Material** created in the previous step and apply it to the Static Mesh we imported. 

## Setting a Default Material 

In this section, we will assign the default Material to use for a Static Mesh whenever it is placed in the level. 

1.	In the **Content Browser**, **Double-click** on the asset you imported from Step 2 of this guide.

	![](ContentBrowserAsset.png)

	[REGION:note]
	Your asset and asset name may differ from the one pictured above based on your import method. 
	[/REGION]

	This will open it in the [Static Mesh](Engine/Content/Types/StaticMeshes/Editor) Editor pictured below.
	
	[REGION:lightbox]
	[![](StaticMeshEditor.png)(w:600)](StaticMeshEditor.png)
	[/REGION:lightbox]

	_Click image for full view._

1.	In the **Details** panel under **LOD0**, click the Material drop-down menu. 

	![](Element0.png)

1.	Select the **Material** created in the previous step from the selection window. 

	![](SelectMaterial.png)

	You will see the preview pane update to reflect the new Material we applied. 

	![](NewDefaultMaterial.png)

1.	Click the **Save** button, then close the **Material Editor**. 

1.	In the **Content Browser**, drag-and-drop the Static Mesh into the level. 

	![](NewMaterialInLevel.png)

	Any time you place this asset in the level, it will use the Material we specified. 

## Changing the Material used by an Actor 

By placing the Static Mesh object in our level in the section above, we have created an [Actor](Engine/Actors) and for each instance of that Actor, we can specify a Material for it to use. This means you can have several different "versions" of the Static Mesh each using a different Material. 

Let us change the Material for our Static Mesh Actor. 

1.	Select the Static Mesh placed from the previous section in the level. 

	![](StaticMeshSelected.png)

1.	In the **Details** panel, (lower-right window in the Editor) you will see a **Materials** section, click the Materials drop-down box. 

	![](ActorMaterial.png)

1.	In the pop-up menu, select a different Material to use. 

	![](TutorialMaterial.png)

	Here we re-selected the default Material, however if you include [](Engine/Content/Packs) with your project you will have additional options. 

1.	You can also drag-and-drop a Material onto a Static Mesh Actor in the level to apply a new Material.

## Creating a Material

To create a new Material:

1. Click **Add New** in the **Content Browser**, then under _Basic Assets_ select **Material**. 

	![](newMaterial.png)

	[REGION:tip]
	Instead of clicking **Add New**, you can **Right-click** in an empty space inside the **Content Browser**. 
	[/REGION]

1. The new Material will be selected and awaiting a name in the **Content Browser**.

1. Give it a name, in this case, name it "Rock" or something descriptive of the red rock texture we are going to use in it.
	
	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/materialNaming.png)
	
	If you happened to click elsewhere before naming the Material, you can **Right-click** on the asset and select **Rename**.
	
1. Once the material is created, you can **Double-click** it to open the **Material Editor**.

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/materialEditorInterface.png)(w:840)

This is the **Material Editor**. The areas we are going to be concerned with in this guide are the **Graph** and **Details Panels**. The **Graph Panel** is the large panel in the center of the window with the "Rock" node in it, while the **Details Panel** is in the lower left of the window.

[REGION:tip]
The **Material** system in Unreal Engine 4 is incredibly powerful. If you would like to know more, see the [](Engine/Rendering/Materials) documentation.

## Rock Material

Using the two textures you imported earlier or any other textures you happened to have imported, we will now flesh out the Material.

1. Select the Main Material Node in the center of the Material Graph. 

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/mainNide.png)

	_It is the only node in the Graph area and it will be named after your Material. It will become highlighted when selected._

1. In the **Details Panel**, change the **Shading Model** from **Default Lit** to **Subsurface**.

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/subsurfaceEnable.png)

1. You will notice that two more pins are enabled on the Main Material Node: **Opacity** and **Subsurface Color**.

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/morePins.png)

1. Now you will need to get your textures into the Graph. While there are multiple ways to do this, we will do this using shortcuts. Hold the "**T**" key and **Left-click** in the Graph area of the editor. This will create a **Texture Sample** Node.

	[REGION:tip]
	You can find a list of all Material Editor keyboard shortcuts in the **Edit Menu** -> **Editor Preferences** -> **Keyboard Shortcuts** -> "**Material Editor**" and "**Material Editor - Spawn Nodes**" categories.
	[/REGION]

1. You should have at least 2 textures, so repeat this process for another **Texture Sample** Node.

	![](textureSampleNodes.png)

1. Select one of the **Texture Sample** Nodes, and in the **Details Panel** under the **Material Expression Texture Base** category, there is a property named **Texture**. **Left-click** on the pull down labeled "None" and select the color texture named **T_Rock_04_D**.

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/textureNone.png)

	[REGION:tip]
	You can use the search field to locate the texture asset by entering **T_Rock_04_D** in the search field. 
	[/REGION]

1. Do the same for the other Texture Sample Node, but select the normal map texture named **T_Rock_04_n**.

	At this point, the Material Graph should look like this:

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/bothTexturesSelected.png)

1. The white pin at the top contains all the color channels in the Texture, connect it to the **Base Color** pin. 

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/connectColorPin.png)

1. Repeat this process for the Normal Map and the **Normal** pin.

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/connectNormalPin.png)

	The Preview should look similar to this:

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/preview_DN.png)

1.  You will need a few Constants (scalar floats) and a Constant3Vector (a color without an alpha channel).

	To easily create Constants, you can hold "**1**" key and **Left-click** in the **Graph** Panel. Create a total of **3** Constants.

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/Constants.png)

1. To create the Constant3Vector, hold the "**3**" key and **Left-click** in the **Graph** Panel.

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/Constant3.png)

1. Arrange the nodes like this:

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/MatConstantsAdded.png)

	_This is just so the connections can be easily made and none of the wires will slide underneath any nodes nor will they cross each other._

1. Using the same process that you used to connect the textures to the **Base Color** and **Normal** pins, connect the **Constants** and the **Constant3Vector** as seen in the following image:

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/allNodesConnectedNoVal.png)

1. You can now adjust the values of each of the **Constants** by selecting them and changing the **Value** parameter in the **Details** Panel.

	* Metallic/Specular Value = 0.0
	* Roughness Value = 0.8
	* Opacity Value = 0.95
	* Subsurface Color = Red (1, 0, 0)

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/allConnectedAllAdjusted.png)

1. The Preview should look similar to this:

	![](Engine/Content/QuickStart/5/preview_All.png) 

In the next step, we will learn about the different methods of manually importing assets.
