[REGION:note]
Before getting started: Make sure you have access to a 3D modeling application. Although we're using **3DS Max and Maya** to illustrate this lesson's goal, you can import **Static Mesh LODs** into Unreal Engine from any 3D modeling application with a save feature.
[/REGION]

Content creators can import Static Mesh Levels of Detail (**LODs**) from external 3D modeling applications.

## Goal

The focus of this guide is to show developers how to import Static Mesh LODs from external 3D modeling programs.

## Objectives

After going through this tutorial, developers will know the following:

*	How to set-up Static Mesh LODs from external 3D modeling applications.
*	How to export Static Mesh LODs from external 3D modeling applications.
*	How to import Static Mesh LODs into Unreal Editor from external 3D modeling applications.

[REGION:warning]
The UE4 FBX import pipeline uses **FBX 2014**. Using a different version during export may result in incompatibilities.

##	Importing Static Mesh LODs

1.	Inside the editor, **click** the **Import** button (pictured below).

	![](ImportButton_UI.png)

1.	Locate and **select** the FBX file you want to import (example pictured below).

	![](ImportDialogBox.png)

1.	**Click Open** to begin importing the mesh file to your project (pictured above).

1.	Inside the **FBX Import Options** dialog box, choose the appropriate settings. (example pictured below).

	[REGION:warning]
	Default settings should be sufficient; however, make sure that **Import LODs** is enabled (pictured above).
	[/REGION]

1.	**Click Import** or **Import All** to import the mesh to your project.

	![](FBX_DialogBox.png)

	[REGION:note]
	When importing LODs, the name of the imported mesh will follow default [Naming Conventions](Engine/Content/FBX/ImportOptions#NamingConventions). Refer to our  [FBX Import Dialog](Engine/Content/FBX/ImportOptions) documentation for additional information about all of the settings.
	[/REGION]

1.	The resulting mesh is displayed in the **Content Browser** if the process was successful (example pictured below).

1.	**Double-click** the static mesh to open the **Static Mesh Editor**. By viewing the imported mesh in the **Static Mesh Editor**, you can cycle through its LODs using the **Auto LOD** dropdown (click the image pictured below).
