Before getting started: Make sure you have access to an image editing application. Although we're using **Photoshop** to illustrate this lesson's goal, you can import textures into Unreal Engine from any image editing application with a save feature.

Content creators can import textures into Unreal Engine from external image editing applications.

## Goal

The focus of this guide is to show developers how to import textures from external image editing applications.

## Objectives

After going through this tutorial, developers will know the following:

*	How to import textures into Unreal Editor from external image editing applications.
*	How to verify that assets were properly imported into the project folder.

## Importing from an Image Editing Application

1.	Inside your image editor, click **File** and **Save As**.

1.	In the dialog box, locate your UE4 Project Directory and **Content** folder (1), enter a name and supported format (2), then click **Save** (3).

1.	On your hard disk, browse to your project's **'Content'** folder to find that your textures have been added.

1.	If Unreal Editor is open, the **'Processing outstanding content changes'** message will appear.

1.	After Unreal Editor imports your content, your textures are ready for use in the editor.

	[REGION:warning]
	UE4 batch imports [supported](Engine/Content/Types/Textures/Importing "Click HERE to learn more about supported images.") image files for you.
	
	If you see the following pop-up message:
	
	![](TextureImportMessage.png)
	
	UE4 just prevented you from importing an unsupported image file.
	
	Also, if you see the following pop-up message:
	
	![](nonpoweoftwowarning.png)
	
	UE4 is telling you that odd-sized images aren't streamed or mipmapped.

1.	Unsaved assets are marked with an asterisk (pictured below).

1.	**Click** the **Save All** button to save your imported textures.

	![](SaveAllButton_UI.png)

1.	A **Save Content** dialog box appears (pictured below). **Click Save Selected** to save your imported assets.

	![](SaveSelectedButton_UI.png)

1.	UE4 removes the asterisk from saved assets (pictured below).

## Verifying Imported Assets

It's good practice to verify that ** *.uasset files ** were imported properly onto the hard disk.

1.	From inside the editor, **right-click** the **'Content'** folder to open the **Folder Options** dialog box (pictured below).

	![](FolderDialogBox_UI.png)

1.	Under **Folder Options**, **click 'Show In Explorer'** (pictured below).

	![](ShowInExplorer_Selection.png)

1.	With Explorer open, verify that UE4 created the corresponding ** *.uasset files **  for your project (pictured below).

Now that we've reached the end of this tutorial, you've learned how to:

&#x2713;	Import textures into Unreal Editor from external image editing applications.
