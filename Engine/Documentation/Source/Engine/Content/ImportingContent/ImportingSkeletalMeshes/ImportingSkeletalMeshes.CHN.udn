[REGION:note]
Before getting started: Make sure you have access to a 3D modeling application. Although we're using **3DS Max and Maya** to illustrate this lesson's goal, you can import **skeletal meshes** into Unreal Engine from any 3D modeling application with a save feature.

Content creators can import skeletal meshes from external 3D modeling applications.

## Goal

The focus of this guide is to show developers how to import skeletal meshes from external 3D modeling applications.

## Objectives

After going through this tutorial, developers will know the following:

*	How to export skeletal meshes from external 3D modeling applications.
*	How to import skeletal meshes into Unreal Editor.
*	How to verify that skeletal meshes were imported properly.

## Exporting Skeletal Meshes from External 3D Modeling Applications

Skeletal meshes can be exported individually or multiple meshes can be exported to a single FBX file. The import pipeline will separate multiple Skeletal Meshes into multiple assets within the destination package.

## Importing Skeletal Meshes

1.	Inside the editor, **click** the **Import** button (pictured below).

	![](ImportButton_UI.png)

1.	Locate and **select** the FBX file you want to import (example pictured below).

	![](Import_DialogBox.png)

1.	**Click Open** to begin importing the FBX file you want to import to your project (example pictured above).

1.	Update the appropriate settings in the **FBX Import Options** dialog.

	[REGION:note]
	Default settings should be sufficient when importing a mesh that doesn't share an existing skeleton. Refer to our [](Engine/Content/FBX/ImportOptions) for detailed information on all of the settings.

1.	**Clicking Import** or **Import All** adds your meshes to the project (pictured above).

	[REGION:note]
	If the **Skeletal Mesh** being imported shares an existing skeleton, **click** the **Select Skeleton** dropdown menu and select the skeleton asset from the list (example pictured below).
