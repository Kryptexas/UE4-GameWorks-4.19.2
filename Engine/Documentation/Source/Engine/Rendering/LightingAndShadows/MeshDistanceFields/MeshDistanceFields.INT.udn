Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) leverages the power of **Distance Fields** to have dynamic ambient occlusion and shadowing for Static Mesh Actors in your games. In addition to that, the Mesh Distance Field 
representation of an Actor can be used for other features like GPU particle collision or even with the Material Editor to create dynamic flow maps and much more. 

Continue reading below to learn how Mesh Distance Fields work in UE4 and some of the ways you can use it in your games. 

## How does it work?

To represent a Static Mesh's surfaces, a **Signed Distance Field** (SDF) is used. It works by storing the distance to the nearest surface in a volume texture. For every point on the 
exterior of the mesh is considered positive distance and any point inside the mesh stores a negative distance. In the example below, the positive distances are being traced and stored
to represent the tree later on.

The first property of SDF that make them useful is that when tracing a ray, you can safely skip through empty space as the distance to the nearest surface is already 
known (this is sometimes called Sphere Tracing). This allows the intersections to be determined with a small number steps. By ray tracing a distance field, a visibility result is produced, 
meaning that if the ray intersects the mesh, the light will then be shadowed.

![](RayTrace.jpg)(w:400)

The second property that makes SDF useful is that when you trace a ray, by tracking the closest distance a ray passed by an occluding object, an approximate cone intersection can 
be computed with no extra cost. This approximation makes it possible to do very soft area shadows and sky occlusion using distance fields. This property is key to features like 
[Distance Field Ambient Occlusion](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/DistanceFieldAmbientOcclusion) as a small number of cones can compute a soft visibility for the entire hemisphere of a 
receiver point.

The entirety of a level is represented by instanced Distance Fields that are stored in volume textures. The landscape has a separate representation through [heightfields]()
that is used specifically for Distance Field Ambient Occlusion, however, it does not affect Ray Traced Distance Field Soft Shadows.

### Scene Representation

Each level that you create is made up of all these Mesh Distance Fields for your placed Actors. When Mesh Distance Fields are generate, they are done so "offline" 
using triangle raytracing that stores the results in a volume texture. Because of this, mesh distance field generation cannot be done at runtime. This method computes 
the Signed Distance Field rays in all directions to find the nearest surface and stores that information.

You can visualize the Mesh Distance Fields that represent your scene by using the viewport and selecting **Show** > **Visualize** > **Mesh Distance Fields**.

When you see areas that are more white than gray, it means that many steps were needed to find the intersection of the mesh surface. Rays at grazing angles to surfaces took many more steps to intersect than would have 
for a simpler mesh.

#### Quality

The quality of a Mesh Distance Field representation is controlled by its volume texture resolution. This can be modified using **Distance Field Resolution Scale** in the [Build Settings](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/MeshDistanceFields/Reference#buildsettings)
of the **Static Mesh Editor**. 

![](Engine\Rendering\LightingAndShadows\MeshDistanceFields\Reference\BuildSettings.png)(w:400)


The Mesh Distance Field quality will be best for levels that are built out of meshes with similar size, as large meshes tend to create a lot of errors. For example, meshes in [Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite) either conform to a grid or are
props placed around parts of the level, which gives the best results with few errors. Landscapes are handled separately by [heightfields](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/DistanceFieldAmbientOcclusion#landscapes) and are not affected by Distance Field resolution.

[/REGION]

The resolution of your Mesh Distance Field should be adjusted enough to capture the important features. As you increase the resolution of the mesh, the memory footprint of the Mesh Distance Field will 
increase as well. In the Static Mesh Editor, you can see the Mesh Distance Field size listed on the top left of the viewport.

When the Mesh Distance Field is generated, corners are rounded off based on resolution. This can be offset by increasing its resolution, but in most cases, should not be an issue depending on the complexity of the mesh. The 
maximum size volume texture any single mesh can have is 8 megabytes with a resolution of 128x128x128.

[/REGION]

For thin surfaces, they can only be represented with a negative texel inside the mesh, which is necessary for finding its root. Increasing the resolution can capture the larger detail more accurately here, but in 
cases where you're only using [Distance Field Ambient Occlusion](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/DistanceFieldAmbientOcclusion) and the surfaces aren't represented properly. Occlusion further from the 
surface will be accurate, so it's often not noticeable with sky occlusion. 

![](QualityCorners3.png)(w:400)


#### Global Distance Field

[EXCERPT:visualizeGlobalDF1]
The Global Distance Field is a low-resolution Distance Field that uses Signed Distance Fields occlusion in your levels while following the camera. It creates a cache of the per-object Mesh Distance Fields
and composites them into a few volume textures centered around the camera, called clipmaps. Only newly visible areas or those affected by the scene modification need to be updated, so composition 
doesn't cost much.  
[/EXCERPT:visualizeGlobalDF1]


[EXCERPT:visualizeGlobalDF2]
The lower resolution of the object Distance Field means that it can be used for everything, but when computing cone traces for sky occlusion, they are sampled near the point of being shaded while
the Global Distance Field is sampled further away. 

You can visualize the Global Distance Field in the viewport by clicking **Show** > **Visualize** > **Global Distance Field**.

#### Foliage

Foliage assets can also leverage the Distance Fields making it possible to have dynamic occlusion or even have distance shadowing beyond what Cascaded Shadow Maps can shadow. 

Below are some options you should consider when using any foliage assets in your games to get the most out of performance and quality. 

#### Two-Sided Distance Field

For high-density meshes (like trees) where you have surface that are usually made up of a masked material that represents many holes for leaves or branches, these cannot adquately be represented
as a solid surface. For this reason, you can enable the [Build Setting](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/MeshDistanceFields/Reference#BuildSettings) for **Two-Sided Distance Field Generation** 
in the **Static Mesh Editor**. This option will work well for foliage but does come at a higher ray marching cost.

[REGION:imagetable]
| ![](BuildSettings_TwoSided.png) | | | | [INCLUDE:#twosided] |

[/REGION]

In this example, the tree on the left is using a default opaque Mesh Distance Field representation. The one on the right has **Two-Sided Distance Field Generation** enabled. You'll notices that the two-sided
mesh distance field is more white than it is gray and the surfaces are now translucent. This means that many more steps were needed to find the intersection of the mesh when generating the volume texture than
the opaque one and will come at a higher cost.

##### Folaige Tool Settings

In the [Foliage Tool](Engine/Foliage), you must enable each foliage type that you want to use Distance Field lighting features for ambient occlusion and shadowing. By default, this setting is disabled because
some foliage assets (like grass) where you would have thousands or tens of thousands of instances would overflow the tile culling buffer. When this happens, you can unsightly artifacts. So, only enable 
**Affect Distance Field Lighting** for the foliage assets that you need.

![](FoliageToolSettings.png)

[COMMENT:none]
#### Landscapes

Landscapes use a heightfield for their representation instead of a Mesh Distance Field. An approximate cone intersection is computed against this heightfield which enables pixels without a Distance Field
representation to now receive occlusion, however, there is no self-shadowing or Distance Field shadowing either. Instead, Landscapes should use **Far Shadows** to for their shadowing at very far distances.

### Culling

The objects that make up the scene are managed entirely on the GPU, which makes culling of these objects to view 100 times faster than when being run on the CPU. 


* Scene objects managed entirely on the GPU
	- CPU sends update deltas
	- Moving an object just requires updating a matrix
* Culling of objects to view 100x faster than CPU
	- 2 million tree instances in Kite Demo >50k on screen @ .1ms on PS4
	- Possible because all operations on objects down the pipeline are on the GPU
	- No graphics API calls are used on objects, because no triangles are involved when ray marching the SDF. This allows the object management and culling to be done on the GPU (along with the
	rest of the technique).

### Enabling Distance Fields 

To enable Mesh Distance Fields for your project, use the file menu to open the Project Settings window by going to **Edit** > **Project Settings**, then select the **Rendering** section. 

[REGION:lightbox]
[![](ProjectSettingsWindow.png)(w:450)](ProjectSettingsWindow.png)
[/REGION]
[REGION:caption] Click image for full size. [/REGION]

Under the **Lighting** category, toggle the checkbox next to **Generate Mesh Distance Fields**. 

![](GeneratedMeshDF.png)(w:450)

When you enable this, you will be prompted to restart your project. 

![](RestartEditorButton.png)(w:450)

The next time you load the project, you will see the following pop-up in the lower corner indicating that Mesh Distance Fields are being generated. 

![](BuildingMeshDFs.png)(w:450)

Once completed, you can visualize the Mesh Distance Fields in the viewport by clicking **Show** > **Visualize** > **Mesh DistanceFields**. You should see a similar view to this.

### Memory Usage and Optimizations

* **r.AOListMeshDistanceFields** which dumps out the Mesh Distance Fields sorted by memory size to the Output Log. This can be useful for optimizing content.
[EXCERPT:optimizations]
* Enable these from the **Project Settings** > **Rendering**: 
	[REGION:lightbox]
	[![](Engine\Rendering\LightingAndShadows\MeshDistanceFields\Reference\ProjectSettings.png)(w:500)](Engine\Rendering\LightingAndShadows\MeshDistanceFields\Reference\ProjectSettings.png)
	[/REGION]
	[REGION:caption] Click image for full size. [/REGION]
	* **Compress Mesh Distance Fields** can be enabled to store the Distance Fields volume texture compressed in memory. It will reduce how much
		memory they use, however, if you're using level streaming, they will cause hitches in your gameplay when these levels are streamed in.
	* **Eight Bit Mesh Distance Fields** can be enabled to store the Distance Fields volume texture in an 8-bit fixed point format instead of the default 16-bit
		floating point. It will only use half the memory previously used but can introduce some artifacts when you have a large or thin mesh.
[/EXCERPT:optimizations]
* Global Distance Field caches mostly static primitives with their mobility set to Static or Stationary. The full Global Distance Field inherits from mostly static cache, so when a Movable primitive is modified
only other Movable primitives in the vicinity need to be recomposited into the Global Distance Field. 


### Limitations

**Limitations of the Distance Fields technique:**
* Support for feature level 5 platforms only (DX-11 and above)
* Only casts shadows from rigid meshes. For Skeletal Meshes, you can use [Capsule Shadows](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/CapsuleShadows) for indirectly lit areas with Distance Field Ambient Occlusion (DFAO) and soft direct shadowing. 
* Materials that deform the mesh through World Position Offset or displacement may cause self-shadowing artifacts, as the Distance Field representation is generated offline and does not know about these deformations. 

**Limitations of the current implementation but can be improved in the future:**
* Non-uniform scaling cannot be handled correctly (although, mirroring is ok). Scaling the mesh by two times or less is not generally noticeable. 
* Only supports Static Mesh, Instances Static Mesh, Foliage, and Landscape (Heightfield). Foliage must be enabled with **Affect Distance Field Lighting** from the Foliage Tool settings. 

**Hardware Limitations:**
* All Mesh Distance Field features have been disabled on Intel cards because the HD 4000 hangs in the RHICreateTexture3D call to allocate the large atlas.
