Description:Guide to placing and sampling AnimationSequences in VimBlueprints

[EXCERPT:Intro]
Playback of **Animation Sequences** can be performed through code, but is generally handled within an instance 
of an _Animation Blueprint_ applied to a _SkeletalMeshComponent_. All of the **Animation Sequences** for the _Skeleton_ 
the _Animation Blueprint_ was created from are available to be sampled within the **AnimGraph**. These can be 
placed as sequence player nodes whose output is a pose generated by sampling the **Animation Sequences**.
[/EXCERPT:Intro]

**To place a sequence player:**

1. **Right-click** in the Animation Graph and expand the **Animations** category.

1. Select the _AnimationSequence_ to be sampled from the list. A node is placed in the graph for the sequence.

1. The pose output of the new node can be connected to a corresponding pose input on any animation node to sample the animation.
