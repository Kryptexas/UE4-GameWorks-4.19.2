[EXCERPT:Intro]
An **Animation Sequence** is a single animation asset that can be played on a _Skeletal Mesh_. These contain keyframes that specify the position, rotation, and scale of a bone at a specific point in time. By playing these keyframes back in sequence, with blending between them, the bones of a _Skeletal Mesh_ can be smoothly animated.

Each **Animation Sequence** asset targets a specific _Skeleton_ and can only be played on that _Skeleton_. This means, in order to share animations between multiple _Skeletal Meshes_, each of the meshes must use the same _Skeleton_ asset.

[REGION:tip]
An example of a **Skeleton** using an **Animation Sequence** can also be found on the [Animation Content Examples](Resources\ContentExamples\Animation) page under section 1.1.

## Editing

[INCLUDE:Engine/Animation/Sequences/Editor#overview]

See [](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Editor) for more details.

## Playback

[INCLUDE:Engine/Animation/Sequences/UserGuide#Intro]

See the [](Engine/Animation/Sequences/UserGuide) for instructions on using **Animation Sequences** within **Animation Blueprints**.

## Notifies

[INCLUDE:Engine/Animation/Sequences/Notifies#Intro]

See [](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Notifies) for descriptions and usage information for the various types of notifications available.

Creation and editing of notifies is performed using the [Animation Sequence Editor](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Editor) in Persona.

## Curves

[INCLUDE:Engine/Animation/Sequences/Curves#Intro]

See [](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Curves) for descriptions and usage information on how to set up and apply curves in Persona. 


## Compression

**Animation Sequence** assets when opened up in **Persona** can have compression applied to them. 

To do this, from the **Menu Bar** select **Asset** then select **Apply Compression** (as seen below).

When choosing to apply compression, the **Animation Compression** window will open.

Each option provides a different compression method as outlined in the table below: 

| Compression Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Automatic** | Animation compression algorithm that is just a shell for trying the range of other compression schemes and picking the smallest result within a configurable error threshold. |
| **Bitwise Compress Only** | Bitwise animation compression only; performs no key reduction. |
| **Least Destructive** | Reverts any animation compression, restoring the animation to the raw data. |
| **Remove Every Second Key** | Keyframe reduction algorithm that simply removes every second key. |
| **Remove Linear Keys** | Keyframe reduction algorithm that simply removes keys which are linear interpolations of surrounding keys. |
| **Compress each track independently** | Keyframe reduction algorithm that removes keys which are linear interpolations of surrounding keys, as well as choosing the best bitwise compression for each track independently. |
| **Remove Trivial Keys** | Removes trivial frames of tracks when position or orientation is constant over the entire animation from the raw animation data. |
