[EXCERPT:overview]
The **Animation Sequence Editor** provides functionality for previewing and editing individual **Animation Sequence** assets. The properties, including compression scheme, of the **Animation Sequence** can be set, and animation notification events - also called Notifies - can be added to allow camera effects, particle effects, sounds, and more to be triggered based on the animation.
[/EXCERPT:overview]

## Interface

The **Animation Sequence Editor** consists of the following:

![](AnimationSequenceEditor.png)

1. **Toolbar** - Displays the name of the _AnimationSequence_ currently being edited.
1. **Track List** - Editable list of tracks for creating/editing notifies. See below for instructions on creating and removing tracks as well as creating and working with notifies.
1. **Timeline** - Displays information about, and provides controls for, playback of the preview in the **Viewport** panel of **Persona**.


## Notifies

An animation _Notify_ is an event along a particular animation at which you can cause something to happen. For instance, the moment a character's foot hits the floor, you can create a Notify along the timeline to play a footstep sound. Other notifies are available as well, allowing for particle, camera, and sound effects. You may also create custom notifies that trigger your own events.

For more information on Animation Notifies, please see the [](Engine/Animation/Sequences\Notifies) page.


## Notify Tracks

Notifies are stored in **Tracks** within **Animation Sequences**. A track is essentially a container that can hold any number of Notifies, and an **Animation Sequences** can have any number of tracks. Using multiple tracks makes it easier to organize and visualize Notifies, especially in cases where an **Animation Sequences** requires large numbers or several different types of Notifies.

Every **Animation Sequences** has a single track by default; however, additional tracks can be added to the sequence and existing tracks can be removed using the controls to the right of the tracks.

**Adding a new track**

In the **Track List**, click the ![](button_track_add.png) button next to an existing track:

![](AddTrack.png)

A new track is added above the existing track in the list:

![](TrackAdded.png)

**Removing an existing track**

In the **Track List**, click the ![](button_track_remove.png) button next to the track you want to remove:

![](RemoveTrack.png)

The track is removed from the list:

## Working with Notifies

Notifies can be added to tracks, moved around inside a track, and moved back and forth between different tracks within the **Track List**. This makes it extremely easy to tweak the position of a Notify or quickly arrange them logically.

### Creating a Notify

Notifies of any existing type or custom Notifies can be added through the context menu. **Right-clicking** on a track displays the context menu. All available types of Notifies are listed in the **Add a notify** flyout menu. Select the type of notify to add to the track:

![](AddNotify.png)

The new Notify is added to the track at the location where you **right-clicked**:

### Positioning a Notify

The position of a Notify within the track is extremely important as it determines when the event that corresponds to the Notify is triggered. Moving a Notify around is easy; just click and hold the **Left Mouse Button** on the Notify and drag the mouse.

Release the **Left Mouse Button** to drop the Notify at that location:

### Switching Tracks

Moving notifies between tracks is extremely easy. In fact, it is essentially the same as the process for positioning Notifies described above. The only difference is you release the notify on a different track than where it started.

### Copy/Pasting Notifies

By **right-clicking** on a notify, you can copy it to the clipboard for pasting elsewhere along the animation, or even into entirely different Animation Sequences. 

![](CopyAnimNotify.png)

You can paste by also **right-clicking** within a notify track. When pasting, you may choose between 2 options:

![](PasteOptions.png)

* **Paste** - Paste the notify at the current location of the time slider.
* **Paste at Original Time** - Pastes the notify at the same time as when it was copied. 

You can also perform actions for multiple notifies by **Shift + Clicking** on a notify to add it to a selection or **Ctrl + Clicking** to toggle a notify from a selection. 

You can drag the selection around and it will remain within the notify panel while keeping snapping intact. 

![](MultipleNotifies.png)

When multiple notifies are copied, by **right-clicking** in the timeline to bring up the context menu, you will notice additional paste options. 

![](CopyPasteMenu.png)

**Paste Multiple Relative** : Paste at the mouse cursor retaining relative spacing between notifies regardless of animation length. This means that the notify group should look like it is spaced the same as before the copy; even if the animation is shorter or longer. 

**Paste Multiple Absolute** : Paste at the mouse cursor retaining absolute spacing. The notifies will retain their exact time spacing meaning that they will fire at exactly the same intervals but the group is not scaled to shorter or longer animations. 

**Paste at Original Time** : Puts all of the nodes exactly where they were when they were copied. 

Addtional Notes: 
* Any paste operation that would put any of the notifies off the right edge of the track will still succeed but the notifies will be clamped into the track. 
* Pasting at the mouse cursor uses the most top-left point in the selection as a reference point for placing the nodes. 
* Pasting a group that would pass below the bottom of the notify panel will add as many tracks as necessary to contain the group automatically. 



## Timeline

![](timeline.png)

The information bar in the **Timeline** displays the following playback information:

| Info | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Animation** | The name of the _AnimationSequence_ currently being edited. |
| **Percentage** | The current playback position expressed as a percentage of the whole animation. |
| **Current Time** | The current playback position expressed in seconds. |
| **Current Frame** | The current playback position expressed in frames. |
