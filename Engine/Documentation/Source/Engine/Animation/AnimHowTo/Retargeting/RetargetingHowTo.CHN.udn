**Animation Retargeting** is the process of repurposing existing animations for use between multiple characters, eliminating the need to create entirely new animations as you can instead share your animation assets between characters. 

There are two forms of Animation Retargeting, one in which the Skeleton of the character you wish to share animations with is using the **Same Skeleton** as the character that the animations were originally created for. The other involves an intermediary object called a **Rig** which allows you to retarget animations from one character's Skeleton and pass that skeleton's Bone information to a **Different Skeleton** using the Rig which both Skeleton's share. 

Refer to the two links below for the type of Animation Retargeting you are looking to achieve:

## Retargeting Using the Same Skeleton

This section will show you how to set up a **Skeleton** to use retargeted animations for all biped characters that use the Skeleton.

1.  Inside the **Content Browser**, open the **Skeleton** asset that is being used for each of your characters. 

1.	In the **Skeleton Tree** of **Persona**, check the **Show Retargeting Options** checkbox. 

	![](HowTo1.png)

1.	**Right-click** on your **Root** bone in the **Skeleton Tree** and select **Recursively Set Translation Retargeting Skeleton**. 

	![](HowTo2.png)

	This will ensure that all bones use the skeleton's static translation (we will modify certain bones for retargeting in a moment). 

1.	Locate the **Pelvis** bone (or its equivalent bone) and click the drop-down box and select **AnimationScaled**. 

	![](HowTo3.png)

	This will make sure that the Pelvis bone sits at the right height and is still animated. Any other bone you want translation to be animated and retargeted should also use this setting. 

1.	Find the **Root** bone, any **IK** bones, any **Weapon** bones you may be using or other marker-style bones and set them to **Animation**. 

	![](HowTo4.png)

	By using **Animation** as the Bone Translation Retargeting Mode, the bone's translation comes from the animation data itself and is unchanged. 

	Above is an example portion of the **Skeleton Tree** set to use the different **Translation Retargeting** methods. The methods used may vary and you may have to experiment with the different methods for different bones to produce your desired results.	

1.	Click the **Grid** icon next to the current Mesh to bring up the Mesh selection box and select a different Mesh (a different character). 

	![](HowTo5.png)

	Try out different animations on different **Skeletal Meshes** to ensure that your Skeleton is set up properly for each of your animations. 

1.	Inside the viewport, click **Show** and check **NonRetarget Animation** and **Bones** to show the normal and retargeted Skeletons. 

	![](HowTo6.png)
	
	You should now see something similar to below on your Skeleton.

Shown in beige above is the original Skeleton along with the current, retargeted Skeleton in white. When retargeting is applied to the characters, the differences in their proportions are taken out of the equation and animations applied play properly on each of the different characters and the original Skeleton (beige Skeleton) is depicted in the same position in both the Short and Tall Characters. 

[REGION:note]
The steps above are intended to quickly get you up and running on how to retarget animations for characters that share the same Skeleton asset. Please see the [](Engine\Animation\AnimationRetargeting) documentation for additional, more detailed information.

## Retargeting Using Different Skeletons

[INCLUDE:Engine\Animation\RetargetingDifferentSkeletons#guide]

[REGION:note]
The steps above showcase how to retarget an animation between two different Skeletons however there are additional measures you can take to improve the quality of the retargeted animation. Please see the [](Engine\Animation\RetargetingDifferentSkeletons) documentation for more information.
