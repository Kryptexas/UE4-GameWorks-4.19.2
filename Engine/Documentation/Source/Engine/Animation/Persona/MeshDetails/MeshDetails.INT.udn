[EXCERPT:Overview]
![](MeshDetails.png)


The **Mesh Details** panel shows specific properties pertaining to the mesh of a Skeletal Mesh, such as the Materials applied to the surface, as well as skinning and LOD options. This panel is only visible when Persona is in **Mesh** mode. 
[/EXCERPT:Overview]

Outside the fact that this panel is reserved for specific mesh editing actions within Persona, it is functionally identical to the standard **Details** panel of the main editor. 

For more information about the basics of using this panel, please see the [Editor Details Panel](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\Details) documentation.
