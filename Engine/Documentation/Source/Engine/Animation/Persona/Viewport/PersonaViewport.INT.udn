[EXCERPT:Overview]
Each of the Animation Tools contains a **Viewport** window which allows you to preview playback of your animation assets. 
[/EXCERPT:Overview]
![](viewport01.png)

The Viewport consists of a **View Options** toolbar (1), a **Movement** toolbar (2), and a 3D perspective viewport of your currently selected Skeletal Mesh asset (3). 


## View Options Toolbar

[EXCERPT:viewoptions]
The **View Options Toolbar** contains a series of buttons that hold options for what is displayed (and how it is displayed) in the viewport.

When opening a Blend Space or Aim Offset, the animation will play automatically if **Preview** is enabled. If you pause or disable the looping option in an AnimationSequence or AnimationMontage and then open a Blend Space or Aim Offset, the animation will not automatically play. You will need to set an animation to play/looping in order for it to autostart when opening a Blend Space or Aim Offset.
