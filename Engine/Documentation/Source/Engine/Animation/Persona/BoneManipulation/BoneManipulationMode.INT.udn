**Bone Manipulation Mode** is a mode in Persona in which technical artists can temporarily translate or rotate bones in order to look for skinning issues in a Skeletal Mesh while previewing animations.

1. Select an animation asset from the list in the **Asset Browser** to make Bone Manipulation Mode available. You can do this in **Skeleton**, **Mesh**, or **Animation** mode. (You may want to pause the animation before manipulating the bone.)

[REGION:note]
After you have manipulated the bone, the manipulation persists when you select different animation assets, so you can preview the change with different animations.

**To return a bone to its default translation and rotation values:**
