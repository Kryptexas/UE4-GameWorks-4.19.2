##Overview 
[EXCERPT:Overview]
**Mesh Mode** of the **Persona** animation editor (accessed by clicking the **Mesh** tab) shares some of the same windows that are available while in other Editing Modes, however there are two windows which are specific to **Mesh Mode** (highlighted below): [Mesh Details](Engine/Animation/Persona\MeshDetails) and [Morph Target Previewer](Engine/Animation/Persona\MorphTargetPreviewer). 
[/EXCERPT:Overview]

##Mesh Details
The **Mesh Details** window allow you to modify properties pertaining to the mesh of the Skeletal Mesh such as **Material** and **LOD** settings, assigning **Apex Clothing**, adding meshes to the existing mesh, adjusting **Mirroring** settings or assigning a **Physics Asset** to the mesh. You can also **Reimport** asset data, adjust **Thumbnail Orbit** or **Texture Streaming** settings. 

###LOD Settings

[REGION:fullwidth]
![](LOD_Settings.png)
[/REGION]

In this section, you can assign **Materials** to aspects of the Skeletal Mesh and toggle whether or not those **Materials** cast shadows or not. 

In the **LOD Info** section, there are settings that allow you to modify how the **LOD(s)** function: 

| Property| Description |
|--- | --- |
| **Display Factor** | Indicates when to use the LOD. A smaller number means use the LOD when further away.|
| **LODHysteresis** | Used to avoid "flickering" when on LOD boundary. Only taken into account when moving from complex to single. |
| **LODMaterial Map** | Specifies the mapping table from the LOD's materials to the USkeletalMesh materials array. |
| **Triangle Sorting** | Set the current triangle sorting method. |
| **Custom Left Right Axis** | Set the Left Right Axis.  |
| **Custom Left Right Bone Name** | Set the Left Right Bone name.  |

###Clothing

![](AddClothing.png)

This section of the **Mesh Details** allows you assign **Apex Cloth** assets to the mesh and view information about the assets assigned, there are also **Physics Properties** that can be adjusted for each asset assigned. 

| Property| Description |
|--- | --- |
| **Bend Resistance** | Bending stiffness of the cloth in the range [0,1]. |
| **Shear Resistance** | Shearing stiffness of the cloth in the range [0,1]. |
| **Stretch Limit** | Make cloth simulation less stretchy. A value smaller than 1 will turn it off. |
| **Friction** | Friction coefficient in the range [0,1]. |
| **Damping** | Spring damping of the cloth in range [0,1].  |
| **Drag** | Drag coefficient in the range [0,1].  |
| **Gravity Scale** | Amount of gravity that is applied to the cloth. |
| **Inertia Blend** | Amount of inertia that is kept when using local space simulation. Internal name is inertia scale. |
| **Self Collision Thickness** | Minimal amount of distance particles will keep of each other. |

###Additional Meshes

This section allows you to add meshes to the existing mesh or remove meshes that have been added. 

###Mesh

This section lists the **Skeleton** that is used with the **Skeletal Mesh** and its location inside the **Content Browser**. 

###Skeletal Mesh

![](SkeletalMeshSection.png)

The **Skeletal Mesh** section allows you to define **Materials** for any **Material Interfaces** that exist and whether or not to enable **Shadow Casting** from the **Material**. The ability to set whether or not to **Use Full Precision UVs** is available which if _true_, will use 32 bit UVs and if _false_, will use 16 bit UVs to save memory. 

###Mirroring

![](MirroringSection.png)

There are two options available inside the **Mirroring** section that can be set: 

| Property| Description |
|--- | --- |
| **Skel Mirror Table** | This lists all the bones that should be mirrored. |
| **Skel Mirror Axis** | Set the Mirror Axis to X, Y, Z or None. |
| **Skel Mirror Flip Axis** | Set the Mirror Flip Axis to X, Y, Z or None. |

###Physics

In the **Physics** section, you can assign a **Physics Asset** to the mesh. The location of the asset in the **Content Browser** (if applicable) is also shown. 

###Reimport

![](ReimportSection.png)

This option allows you to reimport the asset being used and adjust the import settings (also shows the currently used import data and settings when applied).

| Property| Description |
|--- | --- |
| **Update Skeleton Reference Pose** | If enabled, update the Skeleton (of the mesh being imported)'s reference pose. |
| **Use T0As Ref Pose** | Enable this option to use frame 0 as the reference pose.  |
| **Preserve Smoothing Groups** | If checked, triangles with non-matching smoothing groups will be physically split. |
| **Import Meshes in Bone Hierarchy** | If checked, meshes nested in bone hierarchies will be imported instead of being converted to bones.  |
| **Import Morph Targets** | If enabled, creates Unreal morph objects for the imported meshes. |
| **Import Mesh LODs** | If enabled, creates LOD models for Unreal meshes from LODs in the imported file; if not enabled, only the base mesh from the LOD group is imported. |
| **Normal Import Method** | Enabling this option will read the tangents (tangent, binormal, normal) from FBX files instead of generating them automatically.  |
| **Source File Path** | This is the path to the resource used to construct the Static Mesh. |
| **Source File Timestamp** | Date/Time-stamp of the file from the last import. |

###Thumbnail

![](ThumbnailSection.png)

The **Thumbnail** section allows you to set the **Orbit Pitch**, **Orbit Yaw** and **Orbit Zoom** of the camera around the asset.

| Property| Description |
|--- | --- |
| **Orbit Pitch** | The pitch of the orbit camera around the asset. |
| **Orbit Yaw** | The yaw of the orbit camera around the asset. |
| **Orbit Zoom** | The offset from the bounds sphere distance from the asset. |

###Texture Streaming

![](TextureStreamingSection.png)

**Texture Streaming** allows artists to adjust the distance where textures using UV 0 are streamed in/out.

| Property| Description |
|--- | --- |
| **Streaming Distance Multiplier** | 1.0 is the default, where a higher value increases the streamed-in resolution. |



##Morph Target Previewer
