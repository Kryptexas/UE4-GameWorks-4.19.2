The **Modify Curve** control can be used to expose [Animation Curve](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Curves) data which can be modified using arbitrary logic to enable more dynamically-driven animations.

Below, the Modify Curve node is used to drive a curve called **Eye Glow Intensity** where the bear's eyes glow brighter over time.

Inside the [](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints/AnimGraph) of your [](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints), **Right-click** and search for and add the **Modify Curve** node

Once added, **Right-click** on the node and select **Add Curve Pin** and any associated curves you wish to modify.

Pins can be removed by **Right-clicking** on the node again and selecting **Remove Curve Pin** or by **Right-clicking** on the pin itself and selecting **Remove This Curve Pin**. 

With the exposed float pin, you can define any logic you wish to drive the value (below logic is used to adjust the glow of our bear's eyes over time).
