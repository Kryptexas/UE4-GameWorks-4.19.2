## Overview

[EXCERPT:Intro]
Poses can either be in _local-space_ or _component-space_. The **Convert Spaces** nodes available in the **AnimGraph** 
of _Animation Blueprints_ provide the ability to convert poses between _local_ and _component_ space. Local space assumes 
the transform of a bone to be relative to that bone. Component space assumes the bone's transform to be relative to 
the _SkeletalMeshComponent_.

Generally, when working with poses in an _Animation Blueprint_, they will be in local-space. However, certain blend 
nodes and all _SkeletalControls_ operate in component-space. This means that the input pose needs to be transformed 
prior to being passed in to one of these types of nodes. If the input pose is coming from a node that outputs a local 
space pose, the pose must be converted to the correct space before a _SkeletalControl_ can perform operations on it. 
The resulting pose, after the _SkeletalControl_ have performed the operations, then must be converted back to 
local space for input to additional blends or the **Result** node.

Because there is a cost associated with each conversion to or from component space, it is best to group any nodes that 
operate in component-space, such as _SkeletalControls_, so that they are all performed in a row, limiting the number 
of conversions needed.



## Component to Local

The **Component to Local** node converts a component-space pose to a local-space pose.

## Local to Component

The **Local to Component** node converts a local-space pose to a component-space pose.
