[EXCERPT:Intro]
The **AnimGraph** is used to evaluate a final pose for the _SkeletalMesh_ for the current frame. By default, 
each _Animation Blueprint_ has an **_AnimGraph_** which can have [animation nodes](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints/AnimGraph#AnimationNodes) placed within it 
to sample _AnimationSequences_, perform animation blends, or control bone transforms using _SkeletalControls_. 
The resulting pose is then applied to the _SkeletalMesh_ each frame.

Inside the **AnimGraph** you can use values calculated in the **EventGraph** or elsewhere, likely in code, 
and use those as inputs for _BlendSpaces_ or other blend nodes. Of course, you can also just sample 
_AnimationSequences_ directly without any special blending. The **AnimGraph** also allows for the use of 
_SkeletalControls_ to modify bone positions, rotations, and scales directly.

## Execution Flow

All graphs have a flow of execution shown as pulsing links between _exec pins_ on the graph's nodes. For 
regular graphs, such as the **EventGraph** of a _Blueprint_, this flow is visualized during play as it is 
dependent on the firing of events. The **AnimGraph** is different in that it displays the flow of execution 
at all times since it is not event-based and is being evaluated each frame.

In the **AnimGraph**, the flow of execution represents _poses_ being passed from one node to another. Some 
nodes, such as [blends](Engine/Animation/NodeReference/Blend), have multiple inputs and make a 
decision internally on which input is currently part of the flow of execution. This determination is usually 
dependent on some external input, like the value passed to a _data pin_.

In the example below, the same blend node from above switched the execution flow between its inputs based on 
the value of its _Alpha_ pin (the value is being manually set for simplicity):

## Working with the AnimGraph

The **AnimGraph** works by evaluating a graph of nodes. Some of these nodes perform some specific operation 
on one or more input poses, while others are used to access or sample other types of assets, such as _AnimationSequences_, 
_BlendSpaces_, or _AnimMontages_. These assets and nodes, as well as how they fit into the **AnimGraph**, are described below.
