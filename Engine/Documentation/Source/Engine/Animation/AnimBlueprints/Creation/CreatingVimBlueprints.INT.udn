## Overview

You can create an _Animation Blueprint_ in one of two ways:
* Targeting a specific Skeletal Mesh asset.
* Not associating with a specific Skeletal Mesh asset.

## Creating an Animation Blueprint Targeting a Skeletal Mesh

You can create an _Animation Blueprint_ that targets a specific Skeletal Mesh asset by doing the following:

1. **Right-click** on the Skeletal Mesh asset you want the _Animation Blueprint_ to target and click **Create** > **Create Animation Assets** > **Create Anim Blueprint**.

	![Create Animation Blueprint - Menu](CE_create_menu.png)

1. The _Animation Blueprint_ is created in the same folder as the target Skeletal Mesh asset, with the name ready to be edited.

1. If you want to, type a new name for the new _Animation Blueprint_ and press **Enter**.

1. If you are not happy with the default location, drag the new _Animation Blueprint_ to another folder.

## Creating an Animation Blueprint Not Associated with a Skeletal Mesh

You can also create an _Animation Blueprint_ that is not yet associated with a specific Skeletal Mesh asset.  To do so, do the following:

1. Either **right-click** in an empty space in the **Content Browser** or click the **New Asset** button.

1. On the context menu that appears, click **Animation**.

1. Click **Animation Blueprint**.
