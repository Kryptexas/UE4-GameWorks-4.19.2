## Creating Timelines

1. Creating _Timelines_ in _Blueprints_ is extremely simple. In the **Graph** tab, **right-click** and choose **Add Timeline** from the context menu.

1. A new _Timeline_ node is added to the graph.

Once a _Timeline_ has been added, you will be able to see it listed in the **My Blueprint** tab.

## Timeline Variables

Once you have created a Timeline, you will notice it become available as a variable in the **My Blueprint** tab. This is done to allow for reference to the _Timeline_ component, and is particularly useful when having to utilize the _Timeline_ nodes. These nodes exist to allow for access to certain features of a Timeline, such as its play rate.

In this example, we are using the Get _Timeline_ 0 variable to query the current Play Rate value of that timeline.

A wide variety of such nodes exist, allowing you to query values and control behavior of your _Timeline_ nodes. For a complete list of the available _Timeline_ nodes and their functionality, see the [Timeline nodes page](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide\Timelines\TimelineNodes).

## Renaming Timelines

When using multiple _Timelines_ in your _Blueprints_, it is important to name each _Timeline_ accordingly. By default, all _Timelines_ are named "Timeline_X" with a serialized number at the end. You can rename a _Timeline_ by **right-clicking** it within the **Graph** tab or in the **My Blueprint** tab and choosing **Rename**.

## Opening the Timeline Editor 

Of course, creating a _Timeline_ is not useful until you have set it up to do something. To open the **Timeline Editor**, simply **double-click** the _Timeline_ node, either in the **Graph** tab or via its listing in the **My Blueprint** tab.

For more information on editing _Timelines_, please see the [Timeline Editing page](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide\Timelines\Editor).
