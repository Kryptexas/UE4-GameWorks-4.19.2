[/EXCERPT:Intro]

The **EventGraph** of a _Level Blueprint_ contains a node graph that uses events and function calls to perform actions in response 
to gameplay events. This is used to handle events for the level as a whole and to add functionality for specific instances of 
_Actors_ and _Blueprints_ within the world. 

In either case, an **EventGraph** is used by adding one or more events to act as entry points and then connecting _Function 
Calls_, _Flow Control_ nodes, and _Variables_ to perform the desired actions.

## Working with Graphs

The **Graph** panel displays the visual representation of a particular graph of nodes as it shows all of the nodes contained in the graph as well as the connections between them. It provides editing capabilities for adding and removing nodes, arranging nodes, and creating links between nodes. Breakpoints can also be set in the **Graph** panel to aid in debugging Blueprints. 

See the [](Engine/Blueprints/Editor/UIComponents/GraphEditor) for a detailed guide to working with the **EventGraph** and other **Graphs** with Blueprints.
