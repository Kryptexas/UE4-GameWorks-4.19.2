##Creation via Class Viewer

When creating Blueprints via the [Class Viewer](Engine/UI/ClassViewer), it can be helpful to first filter the displayed classes to _Blueprint_ bases only. 

1. In the **Class Viewer** toolbar, click on **Filters**.

	![](class_viewer_filters.png)

1. In the **Filters** menu, select **Blueprint Bases Only**.

	![](filter_blueprint_class_viewer.png)


Once you have filtered the list of classes, navigate to the class you would like to use as a base for your _Blueprint_. In the example here, we are creating a _Blueprint_ with a **CameraActor** as a base.

1. Click on the down arrow icon to the right of your chosen class. 

	![](class_viewer_arrow.png)

1. The option to **Create Blueprint** will appear. Click on this, and the dialog for creating a _Blueprint_ will appear.

	![](class_viewer_down_arrow.png)

1. Enter a name for your _Blueprint_, and select the folder where it should be saved.

1. Click on "Create [Path]/[Name]" at the top of the _Blueprint_ creation dialog, and your _Blueprint_ will be created and open in the **Blueprint Editor**.

1. To save your _Blueprint_ in the Editor and complete the creation process, click on ![Save](blueprint_editor_save.png) in the **Blueprint Editor** toolbar.



You can also access _Blueprint_ creation in the **Class Viewer** by **right-clicking** directly on the class you would like to use as a base for your _Blueprint_. 
The _Blueprint_ creation process is the same as if you used the ![Down Arrow Icon](button_down_arrow.png) to the right of the class.

##Creation from a Selected Actor

1. Select the **Actor** (StaticMesh, Camera, etc.) that you would like to create a _Blueprint_ from in the Unreal Editor.

1. In the **Details** pane, under _Blueprint_, click on the **Create (Type) Blueprint** button. 

	![](actor_details_create_blueprint.png)

	[REGION:note]
	You can also click on the **Replace With Composited Blueprint** button to add the Actor(s) to a new _Blueprint_ and replace them in your level with the new _Blueprint_. 
	[/REGION]

1. Select the path where your _Blueprint_ should be saved.

	![](actor_select_path_menu.png)

1. Your _Blueprint_ will now appear in the **Content Browser**. Save it by clicking on **Save All** in the **Content Browser's** Navigation Bar.
