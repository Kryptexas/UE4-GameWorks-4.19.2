1. From the toolbar in the Main Editor view, click the **Blueprints** button and select **Open Level Blueprint**.

1. In the graph, **Right-click** and add an **Event Begin Play** node and a **Get Player Character** node.

1. Drag off the **Return Value** of the **Get Player Character** and add a **Cast To FirstPersonCharacter** node. 

	![](CastToNode.png)

	Here we are using a **Cast** node to first get the player character, then get the Character Blueprint used by that player (which in this case is called **FirstPersonCharacter** and is where we set up our other scripts for the playable character). By using the Cast node, we are able to access our player character's Blueprint and the variables, events, and functions within it. 

	[REGION:note]
	For more information on **Casting**, please see the [](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/CastNodes) documentation page. 
	[/REGION]

1. Connect the nodes as shown below, then off the **Return Value** of the **Cast To** node, select **Promote to variable**. 

	![](PromoteToVariable.png)

	We are going to create a variable to hold a reference to the **FirstPersonCharacter** Blueprint the player is using so that we do not have to use a Cast to get to it each time. By doing this upon Event Begin Play, it will save us time later. 

1. Select the promoted variable, then in the **Details** panel, rename it to **MyCharacter**.

1. Off the **Return Value** of the **MyCharacter** node, add the **Assign Get Spawn Location** node. 

	![](AssignSpawnLocation.png)

	This is the **Event Dispatcher** we created. When you select this, two additional nodes will be added. 
	
	[REGION:note]
	If you do not see this node in the list, make sure that you clicked **Compile** inside the **FirstPersonCharacter** Blueprint and try again. 
	[/REGION]

1. Make sure you connect the newly added nodes from the **Bind Event**.

	Now, when **GetSpawnLocation** is called in our Character Blueprint, this new Custom Event will also get called. 

1. Hold **Control** and drag in the **MyCharacter** variable from the **MyBlueprint** window, then off it add the **Set Spawn Location** node.

1. Return to the Main Editor window and in the **World Outliner**, search for and select each of the **Target Points** by holding **Ctrl** and clicking each one. 

	![](SelectAllTargetPoints.png)

1. Return to the **Level Blueprint** and **Right-click** in the graph and select the **Create References to 3 selected Actors**. 

	![](AddReferences.png)

1. **Right-click** in the graph and add a **Make Array** node, then connect each of the **Target Points** to it. 

	![](MakeArray.png)

	You can add more pins by clicking the **Add Pin** button. This Array will store a collection of our Target Points which we can access. 

1.	Off the **Array** pin, add a **Get** node. 

1.	Off the **Get**, add a **Random Integer in Range** node with **Min** set to "0" and **Max** set to "2". 

	![](GetNodeAdded.png)

	Here we are getting a random Target Point for use as our Spawn Point. If you had more spawn locations, you could add them to the array and increase the **Max** value of the Random Integer in Range node to include them. 

1.	Off the out of the **Get** node, add a **Get Actor Transform** node and connect it to the **Set Spawn Location** node.

	Your full script should look similar to above, click for a full view. 

We have done a lot on this page! We used a **Cast** node to access our Character Blueprint and then bound a Custom Event to the Event Dispatcher in it. This allows us to fire off a Custom Event in our Level Blueprint whenever the Event Dispatcher is called. We then randomly are getting one of our spawn locations and kicking it back over to our Character Blueprint as the variable Spawn Location (which is used for the location to spawn our rock at). 

In the Next Step, we will allow our rock to be shot and destroyed by using a Bind Event off an Event called **OnHit** (so when the rock is hit).
