In this step, we will set up the logic for allowing the player to press a button to spawn a shootable rock (providing other conditions are met). In our level, we have defined some spawn points and in order to get the location of one of those, we will use an **Event Dispatcher** which will fire off an event in our **Level Blueprint** (which we will create in the next step) to get one of those locations and send it to our Character Blueprint. 


First, let us allow the player to spawn the shootable rock by key press. 

1.	Inside the **FirstPersonCharacter** Blueprint, **Right-click** somewhere in an empty space in the graph and add an **F** Key Event.

1.	Hold **B** and **Left-click** in the graph to create a **Branch** node. 

1.	**Alt** drag in the **IsActive** variable and check the checkbox then connect as shown below.

1.	Hold **Control** and drag in the **IsActive** and **Pulls** variables. 

1.	Connect the **IsActive** to a **NOT Boolean** node (Not true) and the **Pulls** to a **>** node (set to 0).

	In older versions of the engine, the **NOT Boolean** node is referred to as the **!=** node
	[/REGION]

1.	Connect both outputs to an **And** node and feed it into the **Condition** of the **Branch**.

	Here, we set up the logic to determine if the player can spawn a rock by checking if a variable called **IsActive** is not true and if the player's **Pulls** count is greater than 0. If both those statements are true, we will proceed down the **True** side of the **Branch** node and spawn the rock (well, that part of the script still needs to be set up which we will do below). 

1.	**Alt** drag in the **Pulls** variable and connect it following the **Set IsActive** node.

1.	**Control** drag in the **Pulls** variable and connect it to a **Int - Int** node (set to 1) and connect to **Set Pulls**.

1.	Click **Compile**, then off the **Set Pulls** node add the **ResetShots** Custom Event.

	Your setup should look similar to below.

	Our logic for when the player can spawn a rock is set, now we need to communicate with the level to get a spawn location. We will do this by using an **Event Dispatcher** that is called when **F** is pressed. The **Level Blueprint** will listen for the Event Dispatcher and when it is called, will fire its own event that will get the location of one of our spawn points and pass that back to our Character Blueprint. 

1.	Click the **+ Event Dispatcher** button in the **My Blueprint** window. 

	![](AddEventDispatcher.png)

1.	Click the new Event Dispatcher and press **F2** with it selected to rename it and call it **GetSpawnLocation**. 

	![](RenameEventDispatcher.png)

1.	In the graph following the **Reset Shots** function, add the **Call GetSpawnLocation** node. 

	![](CallEventDispatcher.png)

	The Event Dispatcher will be added which is denoted by the envelope icon in the upper-right corner of the node. 

	![](NewNodeAdded.png)

1.	Off the **GetSpawnLocation** node, add a **Spawn Actor from Class** node. 

 	![](SpawnActorNode.png)

1.	On the **Spawn Actor** node, set the **Class** to **BP_Rock**. 

1.	Also on the **Spawn Actor** node, drag-and-drop the **SpawnLocation** variable onto the **SpawnTransform** pin. 

	![](SpawnActorComplete.png)

	Our Character Blueprint is now set up to spawn a shootable rock and receive a **Transform** location to spawn the rock at. 

In the next step, we will use the **Level Blueprint** to get the location of one of our spawn points and pass that information to our Character Blueprint when our Character Blueprint's Event Dispatcher is called (so we are going from Character Blueprint to Level Blueprint and back to Character Blueprint, passing information between them).
