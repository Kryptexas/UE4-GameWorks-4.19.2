Unreal Editor supports source control, allowing teams to coordinate their game development and design efforts, as well as handling version control.

[REGION:note]
	Perforce and SVN are supported by default.

## Activating Source Control

You can activate source control in one of two ways:
* In the Level Editor's **Preferences** window.
* In the **Content Browser**.

### Activating Source Control via Editor Preferences

You can activate source control via the editor's main Preferences window (**Edit > Editor Preferences > Loading & Saving**).

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Prompt for Checkout on Package Modification** | When checked, a prompt will appear when you make changes to a source controlled-package, asking if you would like to check out (lock) that package. |
| **Add New Files when Modified** | This will add new files into source control when they are modified. |
| **Use Global Settings** | Use global source control login settings, rather than per-project.  Changing this will require you to login again. |
| **Tool for diff'ing text** | Specifies the file path to the tool to be used for diff'ing text files. |

### Activating Source Control via the Content Browser

You can also activate Source Control in the **Content Browser**. To do so, **right-click** any asset or folder. At the bottom of the context menu, in the **Source Control** section, click **Connect to Source Control**.

This will open a log-in screen where you can select your source-control system and enter any appropriate settings and other information.

Enter the appropriate information, and click **Accept Settings**.  After source control is activated, the display of the assets in the **Content Browser** will change to reflect their source-control status, and some source-control options will be included on the **right-click** context menu.


## Status Icons

The **Content Browser** will display special icons on the **upper-right corner** of assets to give the source control status. Below are the available icons and their meanings:

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Checked out by you | Checked out by another user | Marked for add | Not in depot | Not had revision

## Source Control Actions

While source control is active, the following context menu will be available when you **right-click** on an asset:

![SourceControlMenu.png](SourceControlMenu.png)

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Check Out | Checks out (locks) the asset for editing. This prevents other users from editing the asset at the same time. |
| Refresh | Refreshes the source control status of the asset. |
| History | Gives a revision history list of the selected asset, allowing you to see previous edits. |
| Diff Against Depot | This allows you to check the asset against the version currently stored in the source control depot. |

## Checking Out and In

To check out an asset for editing, simply **right-click** it and choose **Check Out**. However, when checking back in, there is a certain protocol which must be followed.

* **Right-click** on the asset and choose **Check In**. A dialog will appear with a required changelist description for the check-in. 
* Enter a description, which will be added to the asset's revision history.
* Click **OK** when finished.

[REGION:note]
	A changelist description is required, so the *OK* button will not be enabled until a description is entered.

## Deactivating Source Control

You may find that you want to deactivate source control after activating it.

[REGION:warning]
Only use this option if you are absolutely certain that you do not want to use source control. Deactivating source control will put your content out of sync with your source-control system, and will make it impossible to check in changes.
[/REGION]

**To deactivate source control**:

1. In the upper-right corner of the Level Editor window, click the green, double-arrow icon (![](icon_SourceControl.png)). This brings up the **Source Control Login** screen.
1. Click the **Run Without Source Control** button. The green icon in the Level Editor window changes to a red circle with a slash (![](icon_CB_SourceControlOff.png)), to indicate that source control is not being used.
